## Personalized Ranking for Recommender Systems

In the realm of recommender systems, personalized ranking is crucial for generating recommendation lists that are tailored to individual user preferences. Traditional models often rely on explicit feedback, such as ratings, which are both costly to collect and not always available. This approach has significant limitations, particularly because it fails to account for implicit feedback, which is more prevalent in real-world scenarios. Implicit feedback includes user interactions such as clicks, views, or purchases, which are not directly indicative of user preference but can be more readily available and informative.

### Challenges with Traditional Methods

1. **Explicit Feedback Limitations**: Traditional models focus on explicit feedback, which is not only sparse but also expensive to gather. This makes them less effective in scenarios where implicit feedback is more common.

2. **Ignoring Non-observed Pairs**: These models typically ignore non-observed user-item pairs, which could be predictive of user interests. Non-observed pairs can either indicate a lack of interest or simply be missing values that might turn into future interactions.

3. **Inability to Distinguish Feedback**: Models like matrix factorization and AutoRec often cannot differentiate between observed and non-observed pairs, making them unsuitable for tasks requiring personalized ranking.

### Approaches to Personalized Ranking

To address these challenges, personalized ranking models have been developed, focusing on implicit feedback. These models can be optimized using three main approaches:

- **Pointwise Approaches**: These consider single interactions at a time, training a classifier or regressor to predict individual preferences. This approach is commonly used in matrix factorization and AutoRec.

- **Pairwise Approaches**: These consider pairs of items for each user and aim to approximate the optimal ordering for that pair. This approach is more aligned with the nature of ranking, as it predicts relative order rather than absolute values.

- **Listwise Approaches**: These aim to optimize the ordering of an entire list of items, often by directly optimizing ranking measures such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). However, listwise approaches are more complex and computationally intensive compared to pointwise or pairwise methods.

### Focus on Pairwise Objectives

In this section, the emphasis is on pairwise objectives, specifically:

- **Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) Loss**: This is a widely used pairwise loss function that is derived from a Bayesian framework. It assumes that users prefer certain items over others and aims to optimize the ranking based on this assumption.

- **Hinge Loss**: Another pairwise loss function that focuses on maintaining a margin between positive and negative item pairs, ensuring that the positive items are ranked higher than the negative ones.

By leveraging these pairwise approaches, recommender systems can better handle the nuances of implicit feedback, leading to more accurate and personalized recommendations.

## Bayesian Personalized Ranking Loss and its Implementation

Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) is a widely used approach in recommender systems, particularly for handling implicit feedback. It was introduced by Rendle et al. in 2009 and is designed to optimize personalized ranking by leveraging a Bayesian framework.

### Core Concepts of BPR

- **Pairwise Ranking**: BPR is based on the idea of pairwise ranking, where the model is trained to distinguish between pairs of items for a given user. Specifically, it assumes that a user prefers a positive item (an item they have interacted with) over a negative item (an item they have not interacted with).

- **Implicit Feedback**: Unlike traditional methods that rely on explicit feedback (like ratings), BPR focuses on implicit feedback, such as clicks or purchases. This is more prevalent in real-world applications where explicit feedback is sparse.

- **Optimization Criterion**: The optimization criterion for BPR is derived from the maximum posterior estimator. The goal is to maximize the posterior probability that a user prefers a positive item over a negative one.

### Mathematical Formulation

The training data for BPR consists of triplets $$(u, i, j)$$, where user $$u$$ prefers item $$i$$ over item $$j$$. The Bayesian formulation of BPR aims to maximize the posterior probability:

$$
p(\Theta \mid >_u) \propto p(>_u \mid \Theta) p(\Theta)
$$

Where:

- $$\Theta$$ represents the parameters of the recommendation model.
- $$>_u$$ represents the desired personalized ranking for user $$u$$.

The optimization criterion, known as BPR-OPT, is expressed as:

$$
\text{BPR-OPT} := \ln p(\Theta \mid >_u) \propto \sum_{(u, i, j) \in D} \ln \sigma(\hat{y}_{ui} - \hat{y}_{uj}) - \lambda_\Theta \|\Theta\|^2
$$

Here:

- $$D$$ is the training set of triplets.
- $$\sigma$$ is the logistic sigmoid function.
- $$\hat{y}_{ui}$$ and $$\hat{y}_{uj}$$ are the predicted scores for items $$i$$ and $$j$$ for user $$u$$.
- $$\lambda_\Theta$$ is a regularization parameter.

### Implementation

The BPR loss can be implemented by overriding the `forward` method in the `mxnet.gluon.loss.Loss` class. The implementation calculates the difference between the predicted scores of positive and negative items and applies the sigmoid function to compute the loss.

```python
from mxnet import gluon, np, npx

npx.set_np()

class BPRLoss(gluon.loss.Loss):
    def __init__(self, weight=None, batch_axis=0, **kwargs):
        super(BPRLoss, self).__init__(weight=None, batch_axis=0, **kwargs)

    def forward(self, positive, negative):
        distances = positive - negative
        loss = - np.sum(np.log(npx.sigmoid(distances)), 0, keepdims=True)
        return loss
```

This implementation computes the BPR loss by taking the negative log of the sigmoid of the score differences, effectively encouraging the model to rank positive items higher than negative ones.

Overall, BPR is a robust method for personalized ranking in recommender systems, especially when dealing with implicit feedback scenarios. It is efficient and can be integrated with various models, including matrix factorization and deep learning architectures.

### BPR-OPT in Details

### Detailed Mathematical Formulation of BPR-OPT

Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) is a pairwise ranking approach used in recommender systems to optimize the ranking of items based on implicit feedback. The core idea is to use a Bayesian framework to maximize the posterior probability that a user prefers a positive item over a negative one.

#### Bayesian Framework

The BPR optimization criterion is derived from the maximum posterior estimator, which aims to maximize the posterior probability:

$$
p(\Theta \mid >_u) \propto p(>_u \mid \Theta) p(\Theta)
$$

Here:

- $$\Theta$$ represents the parameters of the recommendation model.
- $$>_u$$ denotes the desired personalized ranking of items for user $$u$$.
- $$p(>_u \mid \Theta)$$ is the likelihood of the observed user preferences given the model parameters.
- $$p(\Theta)$$ is the prior probability of the model parameters, typically assumed to be a normal distribution with zero mean and variance-covariance matrix $$\Sigma_\Theta$$, where $$\Sigma_\Theta = \lambda_\Theta I$$.

#### BPR-OPT Objective Function

The BPR optimization function, known as BPR-OPT, is formulated as follows:

$$
\text{BPR-OPT} := \ln p(\Theta \mid >_u) \propto \sum_{(u, i, j) \in D} \ln \sigma(\hat{y}_{ui} - \hat{y}_{uj}) - \lambda_\Theta \|\Theta\|^2
$$

Where:

- $$D$$ is the training set consisting of triplets $$(u, i, j)$$, indicating that user $$u$$ prefers item $$i$$ over item $$j$$.
- $$\sigma$$ is the logistic sigmoid function, defined as $$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$.
- $$\hat{y}_{ui}$$ and $$\hat{y}_{uj}$$ are the predicted scores for items $$i$$ and $$j$$ for user $$u$$, respectively.
- $$\lambda_\Theta$$ is the regularization parameter that controls the complexity of the model to prevent overfitting.

#### Training Set Definition

The training set $$D$$ is defined as:

$$
D = \{(u, i, j) \mid i \in I^+_u \wedge j \in I \setminus I^+_u\}
$$

Where:

- $$I^+_u$$ is the set of items that user $$u$$ has interacted with (positive items).
- $$I$$ is the set of all items.
- $$I \setminus I^+_u$$ represents the set of items that user $$u$$ has not interacted with (negative items).

The BPR-OPT criterion is optimized using stochastic gradient descent, where the model parameters are updated iteratively to maximize the likelihood of the observed preferences while regularizing the model complexity. This approach ensures that the model learns to rank positive items higher than negative ones for each user, aligning the recommendations with user preferences.

### Hinge Loss and its Implementation

Hinge loss is another pairwise loss function used in recommender systems to optimize the ranking of items. It is particularly useful for distinguishing between relevant and non-relevant items by enforcing a margin between their predicted scores.

#### Core Concepts of Hinge Loss

- **Pairwise Nature**: Similar to Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), hinge loss operates on pairs of items, focusing on the relative ranking rather than absolute scores.

- **Margin Enforcement**: The key feature of hinge loss is the introduction of a margin. It penalizes the model when the difference between the scores of a positive item (preferred by the user) and a negative item (not preferred) is less than a predefined margin. This ensures that the model maintains a strong confidence level in its recommendations.

#### Mathematical Formulation

The hinge loss for ranking is defined as:

$$
\sum_{(u, i, j) \in D} \max(m - \hat{y}_{ui} + \hat{y}_{uj}, 0)
$$

Where:

- $$D$$ is the set of training triplets $$(u, i, j)$$, indicating that user $$u$$ prefers item $$i$$ over item $$j$$.
- $$\hat{y}_{ui}$$ and $$\hat{y}_{uj}$$ are the predicted scores for items $$i$$ and $$j$$ for user $$u$$, respectively.
- $$m$$ is the margin size, a hyperparameter that defines the minimum acceptable difference between the scores of positive and negative items.

The hinge loss is minimized when the predicted score for the positive item is greater than the score for the negative item by at least the margin $$m$$. If the difference is less than $$m$$, the loss increases, pushing the model to adjust its predictions.

#### Implementation

The hinge loss can be implemented by overriding the `forward` method in the `mxnet.gluon.loss.Loss` class. The implementation calculates the difference between the predicted scores and applies the hinge function to compute the loss.

```python
from mxnet import gluon, np

class HingeLossbRec(gluon.loss.Loss):
    def __init__(self, weight=None, batch_axis=0, **kwargs):
        super(HingeLossbRec, self).__init__(weight=None, batch_axis=0, **kwargs)

    def forward(self, positive, negative, margin=1):
        distances = positive - negative
        loss = np.sum(np.maximum(-distances + margin, 0))
        return loss
```

This implementation computes the hinge loss by applying the maximum function to enforce the margin, ensuring that the positive items are ranked higher than the negative ones by at least the specified margin.

Overall, hinge loss is a powerful tool for personalized ranking in recommender systems, providing a clear distinction between relevant and non-relevant items and enhancing the robustness of recommendations.
