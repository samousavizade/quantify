## Overview

This is a sequel to this lecture **linear quadratic dynamic programming**.

It can also be regarded as presenting **invariant subspace** techniques that extend ones that
we encountered earlier in this lecture **stability in linear rational expectations models**

We present a Lagrangian formulation of an infinite horizon linear quadratic undiscounted dynamic programming problem.

Such a problem is also sometimes called an optimal linear regulator problem.

A Lagrangian formulation

- carries insights about connections between stability and optimality
- is the basis for fast algorithms for solving Riccati equations
- opens the way to constructing solutions of dynamic systems that don’t come directly from an intertemporal optimization problem

A key tool in this lecture is the concept of an $ n \times n $ **symplectic** matrix.

A symplectic matrix has eigenvalues that occur in **reciprocal pairs**, meaning that if $ \lambda_i \in (-1,1) $ is an eigenvalue, then so is $ \lambda_i^{-1} $.

This reciprocal pairs property of the eigenvalues of a matrix is a tell-tale sign that the matrix describes the joint dynamics of a system of
equations describing the **states** and **costates** that constitute first-order necessary conditions for solving an undiscounted linear-quadratic infinite-horizon optimization problem.

The symplectic matrix that will interest us describes the first-order dynamics of **state** and **co-state** vectors of an optimally controlled system.

In focusing on eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix, we capitalize on an analysis of
**invariant subspaces.**

These invariant subspace formulations of LQ dynamic programming problems provide a bridge between recursive
(i.e., dynamic programming) formulations and classical formulations of linear control and linear filtering problems that make use of related matrix decompositions.

While most of this lecture focuses on undiscounted problems, later sections describe handy ways of transforming discounted problems to undiscounted ones.

The techniques in this lecture will prove useful when we study Stackelberg and Ramsey problem.

## Undiscounted LQ DP Problem

The problem is to choose a sequence of controls $ \{u*t\}*{t=0}^\infty $ to maximize the criterion

$$
- \sum_{t=0}^\infty \{x'_t Rx_t+u'_tQu_t\}
$$

subject to $ x\_{t+1}=Ax_t+Bu_t $, where $ x_0 $ is a given initial state vector.

Here $ x_t $ is an $ (n\times 1) $ vector of state variables, $ u_t $ is a $ (k\times 1) $
vector of controls, $ R $ is a positive semidefinite symmetric matrix,
$ Q $ is a positive definite symmetric matrix, $ A $ is an $ (n\times n) $
matrix, and $ B $ is an $ (n\times k) $ matrix.

The optimal
value function turns out to be quadratic, $ V(x)= - x'Px $, where $ P $ is a positive
semidefinite symmetric matrix.

Using the transition law to eliminate next period’s state, the Bellman
equation becomes

$$
- x'Px=\max_u \{- x' Rx-u'Qu-(Ax+Bu)' P(Ax+Bu)\} \tag{57.1}
$$

The first-order necessary conditions for the maximum problem on the
right side of equation [(57.1)](#equation-bellman0) are

> **Note**We use the following rules for differentiating quadratic and bilinear matrix forms:
> $ {\partial x' A x \over \partial x} = (A + A') x; {\partial y' B z \over \partial y} = B z, {\partial
> y' B z \over \partial z} = B' y $.

$$
(Q+B'PB)u=-B'PAx,
$$

which implies that an optimal decision rule for $ u $ is

$$
u=-(Q+B'PB)^{-1} B'PAx
$$

or

$$
u=-Fx,
$$

where

$$
F=(Q+B'PB)^{-1}B'PA.
$$

Substituting $ u = - (Q+B'PB)^{-1}B'PAx $ into
the right side of equation [(57.1)](#equation-bellman0) and rearranging gives

$$
P=R+A'PA-A'PB(Q+B'PB)^{-1} B'PA. \tag{57.2}
$$

Equation [(57.2)](#equation-riccati) is called an **algebraic matrix Riccati** equation.

There are multiple solutions of equation [(57.2)](#equation-riccati).

But only one of them is positive definite.

The positive define solution is associated with the maximum of our problem.

It expresses the matrix $ P $ as an implicit function of the matrices
$ R,Q,A,B $.

Notice that the **gradient of the value function** is

$$
\frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x} = - 2 P x \tag{57.3}
$$

We shall use fact [(57.3)](#equation-eqn-valgrad) later.

## Lagrangian

For the undiscounted optimal linear regulator problem, form the Lagrangian

$$
{\cal L} = - \sum^\infty_{t=0} \biggl\{ x^\prime_t R x_t + u_t^\prime Q u_t +
2 \mu^\prime_{t+1} [A x_t + B u_t - x_{t+1}]\biggr\} \tag{57.4}
$$

where $ 2 \mu*{t+1} $ is a vector of Lagrange multipliers on the time $ t $ transition law $ x*{t+1} = A x_t + B u_t $.

(We put the $ 2 $ in front of $ \mu\_{t+1} $ to make things match up nicely with equation [(57.3)](#equation-eqn-valgrad).)

First-order conditions for maximization with respect to $ \{u*t,x*{t+1}\}\_{t=0}^\infty $ are

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 Q u_t &+ 2B^\prime \mu_{t+1} = 0 \ ,\ t \geq 0 \cr \mu_t &= R x_t + A^\prime \mu_{t+1}\ ,\ t\geq 1.\cr
\end{aligned} \tag{57.5}
$$

Define $ \mu_0 $ to be a vector of shadow prices of $ x_0 $ and apply an envelope condition to [(57.4)](#equation-lag-lqdp-eq1)
to deduce that

$$
\mu_0 = R x_0 + A' \mu_1,
$$

which is a time $ t=0 $ counterpart to the second equation of system [(57.5)](#equation-lag-lqdp-eq2).

An important fact is that

$$
\mu_{t+1} = P x_{t+1} \tag{57.6}
$$

where $ P $ is a positive define matrix that solves the algebraic Riccati equation [(57.2)](#equation-riccati).

Thus, from equations [(57.3)](#equation-eqn-valgrad) and [(57.6)](#equation-eqn-mupx), $ - 2 \mu\_{t} $ is
the gradient of the value function with respect to $ x_t $.

The Lagrange multiplier vector $ \mu\_{t} $ is often called the **costate** vector that
corresponds to the **state** vector $ x_t $.

It is useful to proceed with the following steps:

- solve the first equation of [(57.5)](#equation-lag-lqdp-eq2) for $ u*t $ in terms of $ \mu*{t+1} $.
- substitute the result into the law of motion $ x\_{t+1} = A x_t + B u_t $.
- arrange the resulting equation and the second equation of [(57.5)](#equation-lag-lqdp-eq2) into the form

$$
L\ \begin{pmatrix}x_{t+1}\cr \mu_{t+1}\cr\end{pmatrix}\ = \ N\ \begin{pmatrix}x_t\cr \mu_t\cr\end{pmatrix}\
,\ t \geq 0, \tag{57.7}
$$

where

$$
L = \ \begin{pmatrix}I & BQ^{-1} B^\prime \cr 0 & A^\prime\cr\end{pmatrix}, \quad N = \
\begin{pmatrix}A & 0\cr -R & I\cr\end{pmatrix}.
$$

When $ L $ is of full rank (i.e., when $ A $ is of full rank), we can write
system [(57.7)](#equation-eq-systosolve) as

$$
\begin{pmatrix}x_{t+1}\cr \mu_{t+1}\cr\end{pmatrix}\ = M\ \begin{pmatrix}x_t\cr\mu_t\cr\end{pmatrix} \tag{57.8}
$$

where

$$
M\equiv L^{-1} N = \begin{pmatrix}A+B Q^{-1} B^\prime A^{\prime-1}R &
-B Q^{-1} B^\prime A^{\prime-1}\cr -A^{\prime -1} R & A^{\prime -1}\cr\end{pmatrix}. \tag{57.9}
$$

## State-Costate Dynamics

We seek to solve the difference equation system [(57.8)](#equation-eq4orig) for a sequence $ \{x*t\}*{t=0}^\infty $
that satisfies

- an initial condition for $ x_0 $
- a terminal condition $ \lim\_{t \rightarrow +\infty} x_t =0 $

This terminal condition reflects our desire for a **stable** solution, one that does not diverge as $ t \rightarrow \infty $.

We inherit our wish for stability of the $ \{x_t\} $ sequence from a desire to maximize

$$
-\sum_{t=0}^\infty \bigl[ x_t ' R x_t + u_t' Q u_t \bigr],
$$

which requires that $ x_t' R x_t $ converge to zero as $ t \rightarrow + \infty $.

## Reciprocal Pairs Property

To proceed, we study properties of the $ (2n \times 2n) $ matrix $ M $ defined in [(57.9)](#equation-mdefn).

It helps to introduce a $ (2n \times 2n) $ matrix

$$
J = \begin{pmatrix}0 & -I_n\cr I_n & 0\cr\end{pmatrix}.
$$

The rank of $ J $ is $ 2n $.

**Definition:** A matrix $ M $ is called **symplectic** if

$$
MJM^\prime = J. \tag{57.10}
$$

Salient properties of symplectic matrices that are readily verified include:

- If $ M $ is symplectic, then $ M^2 $ is symplectic
- The determinant of a symplectic, then $ \textrm{det}(M) = 1 $

It can be verified directly that $ M $ in equation [(57.9)](#equation-mdefn) is symplectic.

It follows from equation [(57.10)](#equation-lag-lqdp-eq3) and from the fact $ J^{-1} = J^\prime = -J $ that for any symplectic
matrix $ M $,

$$
M^\prime = J^{-1} M^{-1} J. \tag{57.11}
$$

Equation [(57.11)](#equation-lag-lqdp-eq4) states that $ M^\prime $ is related to the inverse of $ M $
by a **similarity transformation**.

For square matrices, recall that

- similar matrices share eigenvalues
- eigenvalues of the inverse of a matrix are inverses of eigenvalues of the matrix
- a matrix and its transpose share eigenvalues

It then follows from equation [(57.11)](#equation-lag-lqdp-eq4) that
the eigenvalues of $ M $ occur in reciprocal pairs: if $ \lambda $ is an
eigenvalue of $ M $, so is $ \lambda^{-1} $.

Write equation [(57.8)](#equation-eq4orig) as

$$
y_{t+1} = M y_t \tag{57.12}
$$

where $ y_t = \begin{pmatrix}x_t\cr \mu_t\cr\end{pmatrix} $.

Consider a **triangularization** of $ M $

$$
V^{-1} M V= \begin{pmatrix}W_{11} & W_{12} \cr 0 & W_{22}\cr\end{pmatrix} \tag{57.13}
$$

where

- each block on the right side is $ (n\times n) $
- $ V $ is nonsingular
- all eigenvalues of $ W\_{22} $ exceed $ 1 $ in modulus
- all eigenvalues of $ W\_{11} $ are less than $ 1 $ in modulus

## Schur decomposition

The **Schur decomposition** and the **eigenvalue decomposition**
are two decompositions of the form [(57.13)](#equation-eqn-triangledecomp).

Write equation [(57.12)](#equation-eq658) as

$$
y_{t+1} = V W V^{-1} y_t. \tag{57.14}
$$

A solution of equation [(57.14)](#equation-eq659) for arbitrary initial condition $ y_0 $ is
evidently

$$
y_{t} = V \left[\begin{matrix}W^t_{11} & W_{12,t}\cr 0 & W^t_{22}\cr\end{matrix}\right]
\ V^{-1} y_0 \tag{57.15}
$$

where $ W*{12,t} = W*{12} $ for $ t=1 $ and for $ t \geq 2 $ obeys the recursion

$$
W_{12, t} = W^{t-1}_{11} W_{12,t-1} + W_{12,t-1} W^{t-1}_{22}
$$

and where $ W^t*{ii} $ is $ W*{ii} $ raised to the $ t $th power.

Write equation [(57.15)](#equation-eq6510) as

$$
\begin{pmatrix}y^\ast_{1t}\cr y^\ast_{2t}\cr\end{pmatrix}\ =\ \left[\begin{matrix} W^t_{11} &
W_{12, t}\cr 0 & W^t_{22}\cr\end{matrix}\right]\quad \begin{pmatrix}y^\ast_{10}\cr
y^\ast_{20}\cr\end{pmatrix}
$$

where $ y^\ast_t = V^{-1} y_t $, and in particular where

$$
y^\ast_{2t} = V^{21} x_t + V^{22} \mu_t, \tag{57.16}
$$

and where $ V^{ij} $ denotes the $ (i,j) $ piece of
the partitioned $ V^{-1} $ matrix.

Because $ W*{22} $ is an unstable matrix, $ y^\ast_t $ will diverge unless $ y^\ast*{20} = 0 $.

Let $ V^{ij} $ denote the $ (i,j) $ piece of the partitioned $ V^{-1} $ matrix.

To attain stability, we must impose $ y^\ast\_{20} =0 $, which from equation [(57.16)](#equation-eq6511) implies

$$
V^{21} x_0 + V^{22} \mu_0 = 0
$$

or

$$
\mu_0 = - (V^{22})^{-1} V^{21} x_0.
$$

This equation replicates itself over
time in the sense that it implies

$$
\mu_t = - (V^{22})^{-1} V^{21} x_t.
$$

But notice that because $ (V^{21}\ V^{22}) $ is the second row block of
the inverse of $ V, $ it follows that

$$
(V^{21} \ V^{22})\quad \begin{pmatrix}V_{11}\cr V_{21}\cr\end{pmatrix} = 0
$$

which implies

$$
V^{21} V_{11} + V^{22} V_{21} = 0.
$$

Therefore,

$$
-(V^{22})^{-1} V^{21} = V_{21} V^{-1}_{11}.
$$

So we can write

$$
\mu_0 = V_{21} V_{11}^{-1} x_0
$$

and

$$
\mu_t = V_{21} V^{-1}_{11} x_t.
$$

However, we know that $ \mu_t = P x_t $,
where $ P $ occurs in the matrix that solves the Riccati equation.

Thus, the preceding argument establishes that

$$
P = V_{21} V_{11}^{-1}. \tag{57.17}
$$

Remarkably, formula [(57.17)](#equation-eqn-pvaughn) provides us with a computationally
efficient way of computing the positive definite matrix $ P $ that solves the algebraic Riccati equation [(57.2)](#equation-riccati) that emerges
from dynamic programming.

This same method can be applied to compute the solution of
any system of the form [(57.8)](#equation-eq4orig) if a solution exists, even
if eigenvalues of $ M $ fail to occur in reciprocal pairs.

The method
will typically work so long as the eigenvalues of $ M $ split half
inside and half outside the unit circle.

Systems in which eigenvalues (properly adjusted for discounting) fail
to occur in reciprocal pairs arise when the system being solved
is an equilibrium of a model in which there are distortions that
prevent there being any optimum problem that the equilibrium
solves. See [[Ljungqvist and Sargent, 2018](/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/References#id186)], ch 12.

## Application

Here we demonstrate the computation.

```python
# Model parameters
r = 0.05
c_bar = 2
μ = 1

# Formulate as an LQ problem
Q = np.array([[1]])
R = np.zeros((2, 2))
A = [[1 + r, -c_bar + μ],
     [0,              1]]
B = [[-1],
     [0]]

# Construct an LQ instance
lq = LQ(Q, R, A, B)
```

Given matrices $ A $, $ B $, $ Q $, $ R $, we can then compute $ L $, $ N $, and $ M=L^{-1}N $.

```python
def construct_LNM(A, B, Q, R):

    n, k = lq.n, lq.k

    # construct L and N
    L = np.zeros((2*n, 2*n))
    L[:n, :n] = np.eye(n)
    L[:n, n:] = B @ np.linalg.inv(Q) @ B.T
    L[n:, n:] = A.T

    N = np.zeros((2*n, 2*n))
    N[:n, :n] = A
    N[n:, :n] = -R
    N[n:, n:] = np.eye(n)

    # compute M
    M = np.linalg.inv(L) @ N

    return L, N, M
```

```python
L, N, M = construct_LNM(lq.A, lq.B, lq.Q, lq.R)
```

```python
M
```

    array([[ 1.05      , -1.        , -0.95238095,  0.        ],
           [ 0.        ,  1.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ],
           [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.95238095,  0.        ],
           [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.95238095,  1.        ]])

Let’s verify that $ M $ is symplectic.

```python
n = lq.n
J = np.zeros((2*n, 2*n))
J[n:, :n] = np.eye(n)
J[:n, n:] = -np.eye(n)

M @ J @ M.T - J
```

    array([[-1.32169408e-17,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,
             0.00000000e+00],
           [ 0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,
             0.00000000e+00],
           [ 0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,
             0.00000000e+00],
           [ 0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,
             0.00000000e+00]])

We can compute the eigenvalues of $ M $ using `np.linalg.eigvals`, arranged in ascending order.

```python
eigvals = sorted(np.linalg.eigvals(M))
eigvals
```

    [0.9523809523809523, 1.0, 1.0, 1.05]

When we apply Schur decomposition such that $ M=V W V^{-1} $, we want

- the upper left block of $ W $, $ W\_{11} $, to have all of its eigenvalues less than 1 in modulus, and
- the lower right block $ W\_{22} $ to have eigenvalues that exceed 1 in modulus.

To get what we want, let’s define a sorting function that tells `scipy.schur` to sort the corresponding eigenvalues with modulus smaller than 1 to the upper left.

```python
stable_eigvals = eigvals[:n]

def sort_fun(x):
    "Sort the eigenvalues with modules smaller than 1 to the top-left."

    if x in stable_eigvals:
        stable_eigvals.pop(stable_eigvals.index(x))
        return True
    else:
        return False

W, V, _ = schur(M, sort=sort_fun)
```

```python
W
```

    array([[ 1.        ,  0.02316402,  1.00085948, -0.95000594],
           [ 0.        ,  0.95238095, -0.00237501,  0.95325452],
           [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  1.05      , -0.02432222],
           [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  1.        ]])

```python
V
```

    array([[ 0.99875234, -0.00121459,  0.04992284,  0.        ],
           [ 0.04993762,  0.02429188, -0.99845688,  0.        ],
           [ 0.        , -0.04992284, -0.00121459,  0.99875234],
           [ 0.        ,  0.99845688,  0.02429188,  0.04993762]])

We can check the modulus of eigenvalues of $ W*{11} $ and $ W*{22} $.

Since they are both triangular matrices, eigenvalues are the diagonal elements.

```python
# W11
np.diag(W[:n, :n])
```

    array([1.        , 0.95238095])

```python
# W22
np.diag(W[n:, n:])
```

    array([1.05, 1.  ])

The following functions wrap $ M $ matrix construction, Schur decomposition, and stability-imposing computation of $ P $.

```python
def stable_solution(M, verbose=True):

           [-2.05  , 41.    ]])

Note that the matrix $ P $ computed in this way is close to what we get from the routine in quantecon that solves an algebraic Riccati equation by iterating to convergence on a Riccati difference equation.

The small difference comes from computational errors and will decrease as we increase the maximum number of iterations or decrease the tolerance for convergence.

```python
lq.stationary_values()
```

    (array([[ 0.1025, -2.05  ],

     0)

Using a Schur decomposition is much more efficient.

%%timeit
stationary_P(lq, verbose=False)
```

    45.5 μs ± 2.05 μs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

```python
%%timeit
lq.stationary_values()
```

    773 μs ± 83.3 μs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)

## Other Applications

The preceding approach to imposing stability on a system of potentially unstable linear difference equations is not limited to linear quadratic dynamic optimization problems.

For example, the same method is used in our **Stability in Linear Rational Expectations Models** lecture.

Let’s try to solve the model described in that lecture by applying the `stable_solution` function defined in this lecture above.

```python

## Discounted Problems

### Transforming States and Controls to Eliminate Discounting

A pair of useful transformations allows us to convert a discounted problem into an undiscounted one.

Thus, suppose that we have a discounted problem with objective

$$
- \sum^\infty_{t=0} \beta^t \biggl\{ x^\prime_t R x_t + u_t^\prime Q u_t \biggr\}
$$

and that the state transition equation
is again $ x\_{t +1 }=Ax_t+Bu_t $.

Define the transformed state and control variables

- $ \hat x_t = \beta^{\frac{t}{2}} x_t $
- $ \hat u_t = \beta^{\frac{t}{2}} u_t $

and the transformed transition equation
matrices

- $ \hat A = \beta^{\frac{1}{2}} A $
- $ \hat B = \beta^{\frac{1}{2}} B $

so that the adjusted state and control variables
obey the transition law

$$
\hat x_{t+1} = \hat A \hat x_t + \hat B \hat u_t.
$$

Then a discounted optimal control problem
defined by $ A, B, R, Q, \beta $ having optimal policy characterized by $ P, F $ is associated with an equivalent
undiscounted problem defined by $ \hat A, \hat B, Q, R $ having optimal policy characterized by $ \hat F, \hat P $ that satisfy
the following equations:

$$
\hat F=(Q+B'\hat PB)^{-1}\hat B'P \hat A
$$

and

$$
\hat P=R+\hat A'P \hat A-\hat A'P \hat B(Q+B'\hat P \hat B)^{-1} \hat B'P \hat A
$$

It follows immediately from the definitions of $ \hat A, \hat B $ that $ \hat F = F $ and $ \hat P = P $.

By exploiting these transformations, we can solve a discounted problem by solving an associated undiscounted problem.

In particular, we can first transform a discounted LQ problem to an undiscounted one and then solve that discounted optimal regulator problem using the Lagrangian and invariant subspace methods described above.

For example, when $ \beta=\frac{1}{1+r} $, we can solve for $ P $ with $ \hat{A}=\beta^{1/2} A $ and $ \hat{B}=\beta^{1/2} B $.

These settings are adopted by default in the function `stationary_P` defined above.

```python
β = 1 / (1 + r)
lq.beta = β
```

```python
stationary_P(lq)
```

    eigenvalues:

        W11: [0.97590007 0.97590007]
        W22: [1.02469508 1.02469508]





    array([[ 0.0525, -1.05  ],
           [-1.05  , 21.    ]])

We can verify that the solution agrees with one that comes from applying the routine `LQ.stationary_values` in the quantecon package.

```python
lq.stationary_values()
```

    (array([[ 0.0525, -1.05  ],
            [-1.05  , 21.    ]]),
     array([[-0.05,  1.  ]]),
     0.0)

### Lagrangian for Discounted Problem

For several purposes, it is useful explicitly briefly to describe
a Lagrangian for a discounted problem.

Thus, for the discounted optimal linear regulator problem,
form the Lagrangian

$$
{\cal{L}} = - \sum^\infty_{t=0} \beta^t \biggl\{ x^\prime_t R x_t + u_t^\prime Q u_t
+ 2 \beta \mu^\prime_{t+1} [A x_t + B u_t - x_{t+1}]\biggr\} \tag{57.18}
$$

where $ 2 \mu*{t+1} $ is a vector of Lagrange multipliers on the state vector $ x*{t+1} $.

First-order conditions for maximization with respect
to $ \{u*t,x*{t+1}\}\_{t=0}^\infty $ are

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 Q u_t &+ 2  \beta B^\prime \mu_{t+1} = 0 \ ,\ t \geq 0 \cr \mu_t &= R x_t + \beta A^\prime \mu_{t+1}\ ,\ t\geq 1.\cr
\end{aligned} \tag{57.19}
$$

Define $ 2 \mu_0 $ to be the vector of shadow prices of $ x_0 $ and apply an envelope condition to
[(57.18)](#equation-eq661) to deduce that

$$
\mu_0 = R x_0 + \beta A' \mu_1 ,
$$

which is a time $ t=0 $ counterpart to the second equation of system [(57.19)](#equation-eq662).

Proceeding as we did above with the undiscounted system [(57.5)](#equation-lag-lqdp-eq2), we can rearrange the first-order conditions into the
system

$$
\left[\begin{matrix} I & \beta B Q^{-1} B' \cr
0 & \beta A' \end{matrix}\right]
\left[\begin{matrix} x_{t+1} \cr \mu_{t+1} \end{matrix}\right] =
\left[\begin{matrix} A & 0 \cr
- R & I \end{matrix}\right]
\left[\begin{matrix} x_t \cr \mu_t \end{matrix}\right] \tag{57.20}
$$

which in the special case that $ \beta = 1 $ agrees with equation [(57.5)](#equation-lag-lqdp-eq2), as expected.

By staring at system [(57.20)](#equation-eq663), we can infer identities that shed light on the structure of optimal linear regulator problems, some of which will be useful in this lecture, when we apply and extend the methods of this lecture to study Stackelberg and Ramsey problems.

First, note that the first block of equation system [(57.20)](#equation-eq663) asserts that when $ \mu*{t+1} = P x*{t+1} $, then

$$
(I + \beta Q^{-1} B' P B P ) x_{t+1} = A x_t,
$$

which can be rearranged to sbe

$$
x_{t+1} = (I + \beta B Q^{-1} B' P)^{-1}  A x_t .
$$

This expression for the optimal closed loop dynamics of the state must agree with an alternative expression that we had derived with dynamic programming, namely,

$$
x_{t+1} = (A - BF) x_t .
$$

But using

$$
F=\beta (Q+\beta B'PB)^{-1} B'PA \tag{57.21}
$$

it follows that

$$
A- B F = (I - \beta B (Q+ \beta B' P B)^{-1} B' P) A .
$$

Thus, our two expressions for the
closed loop dynamics agree if and only if

$$
(I + \beta B Q^{-1} B' P )^{-1} =    (I - \beta B (Q+\beta  B' P B)^{-1} B' P) . \tag{57.22}
$$

Matrix equation [(57.22)](#equation-eqn-twofeedbackloops) can be verified by applying a partitioned inverse formula.

> **Note**Just use the formula $ (a - b d^{-1} c)^{-1} = a^{-1} + a^{-1} b (d - c a^{-1} b)^{-1} c a^{-1} $ for appropriate choices of the matrices $ a, b, c, d $.

Next, note that for _any_ fixed $ F $ for which eigenvalues of $ A- BF $ are less than $ \frac{1}{\beta} $ in modulus, the value function associated with using this rule forever is $ - x_0 \tilde P x_0 $ where $ \tilde P $ obeys the following matrix equation:

$$
\tilde P = (R + F' Q F) + \beta (A - B F)' P (A - BF) . \tag{57.23}
$$

Evidently, $ \tilde P = P $ only when $ F $ obeys formula [(57.21)](#equation-eqn-optimalfformula).

Next, note that the second equation of system [(57.20)](#equation-eq663) implies the “forward looking” equation for the Lagrange multiplier

$$
\mu_t = R x_t + \beta A' \mu_{t+1}
$$

whose solution is

$$
\mu_t = P x_t ,
$$

where

$$
P = R + \beta A' P (A - BF) \tag{57.24}
$$

where we must require that $ F $ obeys equation [(57.21)](#equation-eqn-optimalfformula).

Equations [(57.23)](#equation-eq666) and [(57.24)](#equation-eq667) provide different perspectives on the optimal value function.
