## Overview

This lecture continues our analysis in this lecture
**Cass-Koopmans Planning Model** about the model that Tjalling Koopmans [[Koopmans, 1965](/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/References#id91)]
and David Cass [[Cass, 1965](/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/References#id92)] used to study optimal capital accumulation.

This lecture illustrates what is, in fact, a
more general connection between a **planned economy** and an economy
organized as a competitive equilibrium or a **market economy**.

The earlier lecture **Cass-Koopmans Planning Model** studied a planning problem and used ideas including

- A Lagrangian formulation of the planning problem that leads to a system of difference equations.
- A **shooting algorithm** for solving difference equations subject
  to initial and terminal conditions.
- A **turnpike** property that describes optimal paths for
  long-but-finite horizon economies.

The present lecture uses additional ideas including

- Hicks-Arrow prices, named after John R. Hicks and Kenneth Arrow.
- A connection between some Lagrange multipliers from the planning problem and the Hicks-Arrow prices.
- A **Big** $ K $ **, little** $ k $ trick widely used in macroeconomic dynamics.
- We shall encounter this trick in rational expectations.
- A non-stochastic version of a theory of the **term structure of interest rates**.
- An intimate connection between two ways to organize an economy, namely:
- **socialism** in which a central planner commands the allocation of resources, and
- **competitive markets** in which competitive equilibrium **prices** induce individual consumers and producers to choose a socially optimal allocation as unintended consequences of their selfish decisions

## Review of Cass-Koopmans Model

The physical setting is identical with that in **Cass-Koopmans Planning Model**.

Time is discrete and takes values $ t = 0, 1 , \ldots, T $.

Output of a single good can either be consumed or invested in physical capital.

The capital good is durable but partially depreciates each period at a constant rate.

We let $ C_t $ be a nondurable consumption good at time t.

Let $ K_t $ be the stock of physical capital at time t.

Let $ \vec{C} $ = $ \{C*0,\dots, C_T\} $ and
$ \vec{K} $ = $ \{K_0,\dots,K*{T+1}\} $.

A representative household is endowed with one unit of labor at each
$ t $ and likes the consumption good at each $ t $.

The representative household inelastically supplies a single unit of
labor $ N_t $ at each $ t $, so that
$ N_t =1 \text{ for all } t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T\} $.

The representative household has preferences over consumption bundles
ordered by the utility functional:

$$
U(\vec{C}) = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \beta^t \frac{C_t^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}
$$

where $ \beta \in (0,1) $ is a discount factor and $ \gamma >0 $
governs the curvature of the one-period utility function.

We assume that $ K_0 > 0 $.

There is an economy-wide production function

$$
F(K_t,N_t) = A K_t^{\alpha}N_t^{1-\alpha}
$$

with $ 0 < \alpha<1 $, $ A > 0 $.

A feasible allocation $ \vec{C}, \vec{K} $ satisfies

$$
C_t + K_{t+1} \leq F(K_t,N_t) + (1-\delta) K_t \quad \text{for all } t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T\}
$$

where $ \delta \in (0,1) $ is a depreciation rate of capital.

### Planning Problem

In this lecture **Cass-Koopmans Planning Model**, we studied a problem in which a planner chooses an allocation $ \{\vec{C},\vec{K}\} $.

The allocation that solves the planning problem reappears in a competitive equilibrium, as we shall see below.

## Competitive Equilibrium

We now study a decentralized version of the economy.

It shares the same
technology and preference structure as the planned economy studied in this lecture **Cass-Koopmans Planning Model**.

But now there is no planner.

There are (unit masses of) price-taking consumers and firms.

Market prices are set to reconcile distinct decisions that are made
separately by a representative consumer and a representative firm.

There is a representative consumer who has the same preferences over
consumption plans as did a consumer in the planned economy.

Instead of being told what to consume and save by a planner, a
consumer (also known as a _household_) chooses for itself subject to a budget constraint.

- At each time $ t $, the consumer receives wages and rentals
  of capital from a firm – these comprise its **income** at
  time $ t $.
- The consumer decides how much income to allocate to consumption or
  to savings.
- The household can save either by acquiring additional physical
  capital (it trades one for one with time $ t $ consumption)
  or by acquiring claims on consumption at dates other
  than $ t $.
- The household owns physical capital and labor
  and rents them to the firm.
- The household consumes, supplies labor, and invests in physical
  capital.
- A profit-maximizing representative firm operates the production
  technology.
- The firm rents labor and capital each period from the
  representative household and sells its output each period to the
  household.
- The representative household and the representative firm are both
  **price takers** who believe that prices are not affected by their choices

> **Note**Again, we can think of there being unit measures of identical representative consumers and
> identical representative firms.

## Market Structure

The representative household and the representative firm are both price takers.

The household owns both factors of production, namely, labor and physical capital.

Each period, the firm rents both factors from the household.

There is a **single** grand competitive market in which a
household trades date $ 0 $ goods for goods at
all other dates $ t=1, 2, \ldots, T $.

### Prices

There are sequences of prices
$ \{w*t,\eta_t\}*{t=0}^T= \{\vec{w}, \vec{\eta} \} $
where

- $ w_t $ is a wage, i.e., a rental rate, for labor at time $ t $
- $ \eta_t $ is a rental rate for capital at time $ t $

In addition there is a vector $ \{q_t^0\} $ of intertemporal prices where

- $ q^0_t $ is the price at time $ 0 $ of one unit of the good at date $ t $.

We call $ \{q^0*t\}*{t=0}^T $ a vector of **Hicks-Arrow prices**,
named after the 1972 economics Nobel prize winners.

Because is a **relative price**. the unit of account in terms of which the prices $ q^0_t $ are stated is; we are free to re-normalize them by multiplying all of them by a positive scalar, say $ \lambda > 0 $.

Units of $ q_t^0 $ could be set so that they are

$$
\frac{\text{number of time 0 goods}}{\text{number of time t goods}}
$$

In this case, we would be taking the time $ 0 $ consumption good to be the **numeraire**.

## Firm Problem

At time $ t $ a representative firm hires labor
$ \tilde n_t $ and capital $ \tilde k_t $.

The firm’s profits at time $ t $ are

$$
F(\tilde k_t, \tilde n_t)-w_t \tilde n_t -\eta_t \tilde k_t
$$

where $ w_t $ is a wage rate at $ t $
and $ \eta_t $ is the rental rate on capital at $ t $.

As in the planned economy model

$$
F(\tilde k_t, \tilde n_t) = A \tilde k_t^\alpha \tilde n_t^{1-\alpha}
$$

### Zero Profit Conditions

Zero-profits conditions for capital and labor are

$$
F_k(\tilde k_t, \tilde n_t) =\eta_t
$$

and

$$
F_n(\tilde k_t, \tilde n_t) =w_t \tag{35.1}
$$

These conditions emerge from a no-arbitrage requirement.

To describe this no-arbitrage profits reasoning, we begin by applying a theorem of
Euler about linearly homogenous functions.

The theorem applies to the Cobb-Douglas production function because
we it displays constant returns to scale:

$$
\alpha F(\tilde k_t, \tilde n_t) =  F(\alpha  \tilde k_t, \alpha \tilde n_t)
$$

for $ \alpha \in (0,1) $.

Taking partial derivatives
$ \frac{\partial }{\partial \alpha} $ on both sides of the
above equation gives

$$
F(\tilde k_t,\tilde n_t) =  \frac{\partial F}{\partial \tilde k_t}
\tilde k_t + \frac{\partial F}{\partial \tilde  n_t} \tilde n_t
$$

Rewrite the firm’s profits as

$$
\frac{\partial F}{\partial \tilde k_t} \tilde k_t +
\frac{\partial F}{\partial \tilde  n_t} \tilde n_t-w_t \tilde n_t -\eta_t k_t
$$

or

$$
\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \tilde k_t}-\eta_t\right) \tilde k_t +
\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \tilde  n_t}-w_t\right) \tilde n_t
$$

Because $ F $ is homogeneous of degree $ 1 $, it follows
that $ \frac{\partial F}{\partial \tilde k_t} $ and
$ \frac{\partial F}{\partial \tilde n_t} $ are homogeneous of
degree $ 0 $ and therefore fixed with respect to
$ \tilde k_t $ and $ \tilde n_t $.

If $ \frac{\partial F}{\partial \tilde k_t}> \eta_t $, then the
firm makes positive profits on each additional unit of
$ \tilde k_t $, so it would want to make $ \tilde k_t $
arbitrarily large.

But setting $ \tilde k_t = + \infty $ is not physically feasible,
so **equilibrium** prices must take values that present
the firm with no such arbitrage opportunity.

A similar argument applies if
$ \frac{\partial F}{\partial \tilde n_t}> w_t $.

If $ \frac{\partial \tilde k_t}{\partial \tilde k_t}< \eta_t $,
the firm would want to set $ \tilde k_t $ to zero, which is not feasible.

It is convenient to define
$ \vec{w} =\{w_0, \dots,w_T\} $ and $ \vec{\eta}= \{\eta_0, \dots, \eta_T\} $.

## Household Problem

A representative household lives at $ t=0,1,\dots, T $.

At $ t $, the household rents $ 1 $ unit of labor
and $ k_t $ units of capital to a firm and receives income

$$
w_t 1+ \eta_t k_t
$$

At $ t $ the household allocates its income to the following
purchases between the following two categories:

- consumption $ c_t $
- net investment $ k\_{t+1} -(1-\delta)k_t $

Here $ \left(k\_{t+1} -(1-\delta)k_t\right) $ is the household’s
net investment in physical capital and $ \delta \in (0,1) $ is
again a depreciation rate of capital.

In period $ t $, the consumer is free to purchase more goods to be consumed and
invested in physical capital than its income from supplying capital
and labor to the firm, provided that in some other periods its income
exceeds its purchases.

A consumer’s net excess demand for time $ t $ consumption goods
is the gap

$$
e_t \equiv \left(c_t + (k_{t+1} -(1-\delta)k_t)\right)-(w_t 1 + \eta_t k_t)
$$

Let $ \vec{c} = \{c*0,\dots,c_T\} $ and let $ \vec{k} = \{k_1,\dots,k*{T+1}\} $.

$ k_0 $ is given to the household.

The household faces a **single** budget constraint
that requires that the present value of the household’s net excess
demands must be zero:

$$
\sum_{t=0}^T q^0_t e_t  \leq 0
$$

or

$$
\sum_{t=0}^T q^0_t  \left(c_t + (k_{t+1} -(1-\delta)k_t)\right) \leq \sum_{t=0}^T q^0_t(w_t 1 + \eta_t k_t)
$$

The household faces price system $ \{q^0_t, w_t, \eta_t\} $ as a price-taker and chooses an allocation to solve the constrained optimization problem:

$$
\begin{aligned}& \max_{\vec{c}, \vec{k} }  \sum_{t=0}^T \beta^t u(c_t) \\ \text{subject to} \ \   & \sum_{t=0}^T q_t^0\left(c_t +\left(k_{t+1}-(1-\delta) k_t \right) - (w_t -\eta_t k_t) \right)\leq 0  \notag \end{aligned}
$$

Components of a **price system** have the following units:

- $ w_t $ is measured in units of the time $ t $ good per unit of time $ t $ labor hired
- $ \eta_t $ is measured in units of the time $ t $ good per unit of time $ t $ capital hired
- $ q_t^0 $ is measured in units of a numeraire per unit of the time $ t $ good

### Definitions

- A **price system** is a sequence
  $ \{q*t^0,\eta_t,w_t\}*{t=0}^T= \{\vec{q}, \vec{\eta}, \vec{w}\} $.
- An **allocation** is a sequence
  $ \{c*t,k*{t+1},n*t=1\}*{t=0}^T = \{\vec{c}, \vec{k}, \vec{n}\} $.
- A **competitive equilibrium** is a price system and an allocation
  with the following properties:
- Given the price system, the allocation solves the household’s
  problem.
- Given the price system, the allocation solves the firm’s
  problem.

The vision here is that an equilibrium price system and allocation are determined once and for all.

In effect, we imagine that all trades occur just before time $ 0 $.

## Computing a Competitive Equilibrium

We compute a competitive equilibrium by using a **guess and
verify** approach.

- We **guess** equilibrium price sequences
  $ \{\vec{q}, \vec{\eta}, \vec{w}\} $.
- We then **verify** that at those prices, the household and
  the firm choose the same allocation.

### Guess for Price System

In this lecture **Cass-Koopmans Planning Model**, we computed an allocation $ \{\vec{C}, \vec{K}, \vec{N}\} $
that solves a planning problem.

We use that allocation to construct a guess for the equilibrium
price system.

> **Note**This allocation will constitute the **Big** $ K $ to be in the present instance of the **Big** $ K $ **, little** $ k $ trick that we’ll apply to a competitive equilibrium in the spirit of rational expectations.

In particular, we shall use the following procedure:

- obtain first-order conditions for the representative firm and the representative consumer.
- from these equations, obtain a new set of equations by replacing the firm’s choice variables $ \tilde k, \tilde n $ and the consumer’s choice variables with the quantities $ \vec C, \vec K $ that solve the planning problem.
- solve the resulting equations for $ \{\vec{q}, \vec{\eta}, \vec{w}\} $ as functions of $ \vec C, \vec K $.
- verify that at these prices, $ c_t = C_t, k_t = \tilde k_t = K_t, \tilde n_t = 1 $ for $ t = 0, 1, \ldots, T $.

Thus, we guess that for $ t=0,\dots,T $:

$$
q_t^0 = \beta^t u'(C_t) \tag{35.2}
$$

$$
w_t = f(K_t) -K_t f'(K_t) \tag{35.3}
$$

$$
\eta_t = f'(K_t) \tag{35.4}
$$

At these prices, let capital chosen by the household be

$$
k^*_t(\vec {q}, \vec{w}, \vec{\eta)} , \quad t \geq 0 \tag{35.5}
$$

and let the allocation chosen by the firm be

$$
\tilde k^*_t(\vec{q}, \vec{w}, \vec{\eta}), \quad t \geq 0
$$

and so on.

If our guess for the equilibrium price system is correct, then it
must occur that

$$
k_t^*  = \tilde k_t^* \tag{35.6}
$$

$$
1   = \tilde n_t^* \tag{35.7}
$$

$$
c_t^* + k_{t+1}^* - (1-\delta) k_t^*  = F(\tilde k_t^*, \tilde n_t^*)
$$

We shall verify that for $ t=0,\dots,T $ allocations chosen
by the household and the firm both equal the allocation that solves
the planning problem:

$$
k^*_t = \tilde k^*_t=K_t, \tilde n_t=1, c^*_t=C_t \tag{35.8}
$$

### Verification Procedure

Our approach is firsts to stare at first-order necessary conditions for
optimization problems of the household and the firm.

At the price system we have guessed, we’ll then verify that both sets of first-order
conditions are satisfied at the allocation that solves the planning
problem.

### Household’s Lagrangian

To solve the household’s problem, we formulate the Lagrangian

$$
\mathcal{L}(\vec{c},\vec{k},\lambda) = \sum_{t=0}^T \beta^t u(c_t)+ \lambda \left(\sum_{t=0}^T q_t^0\left(\left((1-\delta) k_t -w_t\right)
+\eta_t k_t -c_t  - k_{t+1}\right)\right)
$$

and attack the min-max problem:

$$
\min_{\lambda} \max_{\vec{c},\vec{k}}  \mathcal{L}(\vec{c},\vec{k},\lambda)
$$

First-order conditions are

$$
c_t: \quad \beta^t u'(c_t)-\lambda q_t^0=0 \quad  t=0,1,\dots,T \tag{35.9}
$$

$$
k_t: \quad -\lambda q_t^0 \left[(1-\delta)+\eta_t \right]+\lambda q^0_{t-1}=0 \quad  t=1,2,\dots,T+1 \tag{35.10}
$$

$$
\lambda:  \quad \left(\sum_{t=0}^T q_t^0\left(c_t + \left(k_{t+1}-(1-\delta) k_t\right) -w_t -\eta_t k_t\right)\right) \leq 0 \tag{35.11}
$$

$$
k_{T+1}: \quad -\lambda q_0^{T+1} \leq 0, \ \leq 0 \text{ if } k_{T+1}=0; \ =0 \text{ if } k_{T+1}>0 \tag{35.12}
$$

Now we plug in our guesses of prices and do some algebra in the hope of recovering all first-order necessary conditions for the planning problem from this lecture **Cass-Koopmans Planning Model**

Combining [(35.9)](#equation-cond1) and [(35.2)](#equation-eq-price), we get:

$$
u'(C_t) = \mu_t
$$

which is (34.9).

Combining [(35.10)](#equation-cond2), [(35.2)](#equation-eq-price), and
[(35.4)](#equation-eq-price3), we get:

$$
-\lambda \beta^t \mu_t\left[(1-\delta) +f'(K_t)\right] +\lambda \beta^{t-1}\mu_{t-1}=0 \tag{35.13}
$$

Rewriting [(35.13)](#equation-co-re) by dividing by $ \lambda $ on
both sides (which is nonzero since u’>0) we get:

$$
\beta^t \mu_t [(1-\delta+f'(K_t)] = \beta^{t-1} \mu_{t-1}
$$

or

$$
\beta \mu_t [(1-\delta+f'(K_t)] = \mu_{t-1}
$$

which is (34.10).

Combining [(35.11)](#equation-cond3), [(35.2)](#equation-eq-price), [(35.3)](#equation-eq-price2)
and [(35.4)](#equation-eq-price3) after multiplying both sides of
[(35.11)](#equation-cond3) by $ \lambda $, we get

$$
\sum_{t=0}^T \beta^t \mu_{t} \left(C_t+ (K_{t+1} -(1-\delta)K_t)-f(K_t)+K_t f'(K_t)-f'(K_t)K_t\right) \leq 0
$$

which simplifies to

$$
\sum_{t=0}^T  \beta^t \mu_{t} \left(C_t +K_{t+1} -(1-\delta)K_t - F(K_t,1)\right) \leq 0
$$

Since $ \beta^t \mu_t >0 $ for $ t =0, \ldots, T $, it follows that

$$
C_t+K_{t+1}-(1-\delta)K_t -F(K_t,1)=0 \quad  \text{ for all }t \text{ in } \{0, 1, \ldots, T\}
$$

which is (34.11).

Combining [(35.12)](#equation-cond4) and [(35.2)](#equation-eq-price), we get:

$$
-\beta^{T+1} \mu_{T+1} \leq 0
$$

Dividing both sides by $ \beta^{T+1} $ gives

$$
-\mu_{T+1} \leq 0
$$

which is (34.12) for the planning problem.

Thus, at our guess of the equilibrium price system, the allocation
that solves the planning problem also solves the problem faced by a
representative household living in a competitive equilibrium.

### Representative Firm’s Problem

We now turn to the problem faced by a firm in a competitive
equilibrium:

If we plug [(35.8)](#equation-eq-pl) into [(35.1)](#equation-zero-profits) for all t, we
get

$$
\frac{\partial F(K_t, 1)}{\partial K_t} = f'(K_t) = \eta_t
$$

which is [(35.4)](#equation-eq-price3).

If we now plug [(35.8)](#equation-eq-pl) into [(35.1)](#equation-zero-profits) for all t, we
get:

$$
\frac{\partial F(\tilde K_t, 1)}{\partial \tilde L_t} = f(K_t)-f'(K_t)K_t=w_t
$$

which is exactly [(35.5)](#equation-eq-pr4).

Thus, at our guess for the equilibrium price system, the allocation
that solves the planning problem also solves the problem faced by a firm
within a competitive equilibrium.

By [(35.6)](#equation-ge1) and [(35.7)](#equation-ge2) this allocation is
identical to the one that solves the consumer’s problem.

> **Note**Because budget sets are affected only by relative prices,
> $ \{q^0_t\} $ is determined only up to multiplication by a
> positive constant.

**Normalization:** We are free to choose a $ \{q_t^0\} $ that
makes $ \lambda=1 $ so that we are measuring $ q_t^0 $ in
units of the marginal utility of time $ 0 $ goods.

We will plot $ q, w, \eta $ below to show these equilibrium prices
induce the same aggregate movements that we saw earlier in the planning
problem.

To proceed, we bring in Python code that **Cass-Koopmans Planning Model** used to solve the planning problem

First let’s define a `jitclass` that stores parameters and functions
they characterize an economy.

```python
planning_data = [
    ('γ', float64),    # Coefficient of relative risk aversion
    ('β', float64),    # Discount factor

    ('A', float64)     # Technology

                print('Converged successfully on iteration ', i+1)
            return c_vec, k_vec

        i += 1
        if i == max_iter:
            if verbose:
                print('Convergence failed.')
            return c_vec, k_vec

        # if iteration continues, updates boundaries and guess of c0
        if error > 0:
            c0_lower = c0
        else:
            c0_upper = c0

        c0 = (c0_lower + c0_upper) / 2
```

```python
pp = PlanningProblem()

# Steady states
ρ = 1 / pp.β - 1
k_ss = pp.f_prime_inv(ρ+pp.δ)
c_ss = pp.f(k_ss) - pp.δ * k_ss
```

The above code from this lecture **Cass-Koopmans Planning Model** lets us compute an optimal allocation for the planning problem.

- from the preceding analysis, we know that it will also be an allocation associated with a competitive equilibium.

Now we’re ready to bring in Python code that we require to compute additional objects that appear in a competitive equilibrium.

```python
@njit
def q(pp, c_path):
    # Here we choose numeraire to be u'(c_0) -- this is q^(t_0)_t
    T = len(c_path) - 1
    q_path = np.ones(T+1)
    q_path[0] = 1
    for t in range(1, T+1):
        q_path[t] = pp.β ** t * pp.u_prime(c_path[t])
    return q_path

@njit
def w(pp, k_path):
    w_path = pp.f(k_path) - k_path * pp.f_prime(k_path)
    return w_path

@njit
def η(pp, k_path):
    η_path = pp.f_prime(k_path)
    return η_path
```

Now we calculate and plot for each $ T $

```python
T_arr = [250, 150, 75, 50]

fix, axs = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(13, 6))
titles = ['Arrow-Hicks Prices', 'Labor Rental Rate', 'Capital Rental Rate',
          'Consumption', 'Capital', 'Lagrange Multiplier']
ylabels = ['$q_t^0$', '$w_t$', '$\eta_t$', '$c_t$', '$k_t$', '$\mu_t$']

for T in T_arr:
    c_path, k_path = bisection(pp, 0.3, k_ss/3, T, verbose=False)
    μ_path = pp.u_prime(c_path)

    q_path = q(pp, c_path)
    w_path = w(pp, k_path)[:-1]
    η_path = η(pp, k_path)[:-1]
    paths = [q_path, w_path, η_path, c_path, k_path, μ_path]

    for i, ax in enumerate(axs.flatten()):
        ax.plot(paths[i])
        ax.set(title=titles[i], ylabel=ylabels[i], xlabel='t')
        if titles[i] == 'Capital':
            ax.axhline(k_ss, lw=1, ls='--', c='k')
        if titles[i] == 'Consumption':
            ax.axhline(c_ss, lw=1, ls='--', c='k')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### Varying Curvature

Now we see how our results change if we keep $ T $ constant, but allow
the curvature parameter, $ \gamma $ to vary, starting
with $ K_0 $ below the steady state.

We plot the results for $ T=150 $

```python
T = 150
γ_arr = [1.1, 4, 6, 8]

fix, axs = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(13, 6))

for γ in γ_arr:
    pp_γ = PlanningProblem(γ=γ)
    c_path, k_path = bisection(pp_γ, 0.3, k_ss/3, T, verbose=False)
    μ_path = pp_γ.u_prime(c_path)

    q_path = q(pp_γ, c_path)
    w_path = w(pp_γ, k_path)[:-1]
    η_path = η(pp_γ, k_path)[:-1]
    paths = [q_path, w_path, η_path, c_path, k_path, μ_path]

    for i, ax in enumerate(axs.flatten()):
        ax.plot(paths[i], label=f'$\gamma = {γ}$')
        ax.set(title=titles[i], ylabel=ylabels[i], xlabel='t')
        if titles[i] == 'Capital':
            ax.axhline(k_ss, lw=1, ls='--', c='k')
        if titles[i] == 'Consumption':
            ax.axhline(c_ss, lw=1, ls='--', c='k')

axs[0, 0].legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

<div
  className="my-1 overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2"
  style={{
    display: 'block',
    marginLeft: 'auto',

Adjusting $ \gamma $ means adjusting how much individuals prefer
to smooth consumption.

Higher $ \gamma $ means individuals prefer to smooth more
resulting in slower convergence to a steady state allocation.

Lower $ \gamma $ means individuals prefer to smooth less,
resulting in faster convergence to a steady state allocation.

## Yield Curves and Hicks-Arrow Prices

We return to Hicks-Arrow prices and calculate how they are related to **yields** on loans of alternative maturities.

This will let us plot a **yield curve** that graphs yields on bonds of maturities $ j=1, 2, \ldots $ against $ j=1,2, \ldots $.

We use the following formulas.

A **yield to maturity** on a loan made at time $ t_0 $ that matures at time $ t > t_0 $

$$
r_{t_0,t}= -\frac{\log q^{t_0}_t}{t - t_0}
$$

A Hicks-Arrow price system for a base-year $ t_0\leq t $ satisfies

$$
q^{t_0}_t = \beta^{t-t_0} \frac{u'(c_t)}{u'(c_{t_0})}= \beta^{t-t_0}
\frac{c_t^{-\gamma}}{c_{t_0}^{-\gamma}}
$$

We redefine our function for $ q $ to allow arbitrary base
years, and define a new function for $ r $, then plot both.

We begin by continuing to assume that $ t_0=0 $ and plot things for different maturities $ t=T $, with $ K_0 $ below the steady state

```python
@njit
def q_generic(pp, t0, c_path):
    # simplify notations
    β = pp.β
    u_prime = pp.u_prime

    T = len(c_path) - 1
    q_path = np.zeros(T+1-t0)
    q_path[0] = 1
    for t in range(t0+1, T+1):
        q_path[t-t0] = β ** (t-t0) * u_prime(c_path[t]) / u_prime(c_path[t0])
    return q_path

@njit
def r(pp, t0, q_path):
    '''Yield to maturity'''
    r_path = - np.log(q_path[1:]) / np.arange(1, len(q_path))
    return r_path

def plot_yield_curves(pp, t0, c0, k0, T_arr):

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))

    for T in T_arr:
        c_path, k_path = bisection(pp, c0, k0, T, verbose=False)
        q_path = q_generic(pp, t0, c_path)
        r_path = r(pp, t0, q_path)

        axs[0].plot(range(t0, T+1), q_path)
        axs[0].set(xlabel='t', ylabel='$q_t^0$', title='Hicks-Arrow Prices')

        axs[1].plot(range(t0+1, T+1), r_path)
        axs[1].set(xlabel='t', ylabel='$r_t^0$', title='Yields')
```

```python
T_arr = [150, 75, 50]
plot_yield_curves(pp, 0, 0.3, k_ss/3, T_arr)
```

<div
  className="my-1 overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2"
  style={{
    display: 'block',
    marginLeft: 'auto',
    marginRight: 'auto',
    width: '90%',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',

</div>

Now we plot when $ t_0=20 $

```python
plot_yield_curves(pp, 20, 0.3, k_ss/3, T_arr)
```

<div
  className="my-1 overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2"
  style={{
    display: 'block',
    marginLeft: 'auto',
    marginRight: 'auto',
    width: '90%',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
