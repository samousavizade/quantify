# Competitive Equilibria with Arrow Securities

## Introduction

This lecture presents Python code for experimenting with competitive equilibria of an infinite-horizon pure exchange economy with

- Heterogeneous agents
- Endowments of a single consumption that are person-specific functions of a common Markov state
- Complete markets in one-period Arrow state-contingent securities
- Discounted expected utility preferences of a kind often used in macroeconomics and finance
- Common expected utility preferences across agents
- Common beliefs among agents
- A constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) one-period utility function that implies the existence of a representative consumer whose consumption process can be plugged into a formula for the pricing kernel for one-step Arrow securities and thereby determine equilibrium prices before determining an equilibrium distribution of wealth
- Differences in their endowments make individuals want to reallocate consumption goods across time and Markov states

We impose restrictions that allow us to **Bellmanize** competitive equilibrium prices and quantities

We use Bellman equations to describe

- asset prices
- continuation wealth levels for each person
- state-by-state natural debt limits for each person

In the course of presenting the model we shall encounter these important ideas

- a **resolvent operator** widely used in this class of models
- absence of **borrowing limits** in finite horizon economies
- state-by-state **borrowing limits** required in infinite horizon economies
- a counterpart of the **law of iterated expectations** known as a **law of iterated values**
- a **state-variable degeneracy** that prevails within a competitive equilibrium and that opens the way to various appearances of resolvent operators

## The setting

In effect, this lecture implements a Python version of the model presented in section 9.3.3 of Ljungqvist and Sargent [[Ljungqvist and Sargent, 2018](/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/References#id186)].

### Preferences and endowments

In each period $ t\geq 0 $, a stochastic
event $ s_t \in {\bf S} $ is realized.

Let the history of events up until time $ t $
be denoted $ s^t = [s_0, s_{1}, \ldots, s_{t-1}, s_t] $.

(Sometimes we inadvertently reverse the recording order and denote a history as $ s^t = [s_t, s_{t-1}, \ldots, s_1, s_0] $.)

The unconditional
probability of observing a particular sequence of events $ s^t $ is
given by a probability measure $ \pi_t(s^t) $.

For $ t > \tau $, we write the probability
of observing $ s^t $ conditional on the realization of $ s^\tau $as $ \pi_t(s^t\vert s^\tau) $.

We assume that trading occurs after
observing $ s_0 $,
which we capture by setting $ \pi_0(s_0)=1 $ for the initially
given value of $ s_0 $.

In this lecture we shall follow much macroeconomics and econometrics and assume that
$ \pi_t(s^t) $ is induced by a Markov process.

There are $ K $ consumers named $ k=1, \ldots , K $.

Consumer $ k $
owns a stochastic endowment of one good
$ y_t^k(s^t) $ that depends on the
history $ s^t $.

The history $ s^t $ is publicly observable.

Consumer $ k $
purchases a history-dependent consumption plan $ c^k =
\{c*t^k(s^t)\}*{t=0}^\infty $

Consumer $ k $ orders consumption plans by

$$
U_k(c^k) =
\sum_{t=0}^\infty \sum_{s^t} \beta^t u_k[c_t^k(s^t)]
\pi_t(s^t),
$$

where $ 0 < \beta < 1 $.

The right side is equal to $ E*0 \sum*{t=0}^\infty \beta^t
u_k(c_t^k) $, where $ E_0 $ is the mathematical expectation operator,
conditioned on $ s_0 $.

Here $ u_k(c) $ is an increasing, twice
continuously differentiable, strictly concave function of
consumption $ c\geq 0 $ of one good.

The utility function of person $ k $ satisfies
the Inada condition

$$
\lim_{c \downarrow 0} u'_k(c) = +\infty.
$$

This condition implies that each
agent chooses strictly positive consumption for every
date-history pair $ (t, s^t) $.

Those interior solutions enable us to confine our
analysis to Euler equations that hold with equality and also guarantee that
**natural debt limits** don’t bind in economies like ours with
sequential trading of Arrow securities.

We adopt the assumption, routinely
employed in much of macroeconomics,
that consumers share probabilities $ \pi_t(s^t) $ for all $ t $ and $ s^t $.

A **feasible allocation** satisfies

$$
\sum_i c_t^k(s^t) \leq \sum_i y_t^k(s^t)
$$

for all $ t $ and for all $ s^t $.

## Recursive Formulation

Following descriptions in section 9.3.3 of Ljungqvist and Sargent [[Ljungqvist and Sargent, 2018](/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/References#id186)] chapter 9, we set up a competitive equilibrium of a pure exchange economy with complete markets in one-period Arrow securities.

When endowments $ y^k(s) $ are all functions of a common Markov state $ s $,
the pricing kernel takes the form $ Q(s'|s) $, where $ Q(s'| s) $ is the price of one unit of consumption
in state $ s' $ at date $ t+1 $ when the Markov state at date $ t $ is $ s $.

These enable us to provide a
recursive formulation of a consumer’s optimization problem.

Consumer $ k $’s state at time $ t $ is its financial wealth $ a^k_t $ and Markov state $ s_t $.

Let $ v^k(a,s) $ be the optimal value of consumer $ k $’s problem
starting from state $ (a, s) $.

- $ v^k(a,s) $ is the maximum expected discounted utility that consumer $ k $ with current financial wealth $ a $ can attain in Markov state $ s $.

The optimal value function satisfies the Bellman equation

$$
v^k(a, s) = \max_{c, \hat a(s')} \left\{ u_k(c) + \beta \sum_{s'} v^k[\hat a(s'),s'] \pi (s' | s) \right\}
$$

where maximization is subject to the budget constraint

$$
c + \sum_{s'} \hat a(s') Q(s' | s)
\leq  y^k(s) + a
$$

and also the constraints

$$
\begin{aligned}
c & \geq 0, \\
-   \hat a(s') & \leq \bar A^k(s'), \hskip.5cm \forall s' \in {\bf S}
\end{aligned}
$$

with the second constraint evidently being a set of state-by-state debt limits.

Note that the value function and decision rule that solve the Bellman equation implicitly depend
on the pricing kernel $ Q(\cdot \vert \cdot) $ because it appears in the agent’s budget constraint.

Use the first-order conditions for the
problem on the right of the Bellman equation and a
Benveniste-Scheinkman formula and rearrange to get

$$
Q(s_{t+1} | s_t ) = {\beta u'_k(c_{t+1}^k) \pi(s_{t+1} | s_t)
\over u'_k(c_t^k) },
$$

where it is understood that $ c*t^k = c^k(s_t) $
and $ c*{t+1}^k = c^k(s\_{t+1}) $.

A **recursive competitive equilibrium** is
an initial distribution of wealth $ \vec a*0 $, a set of borrowing limits $ \{\bar A^k(s)\}*{k=1}^K $,
a pricing kernel $ Q(s' | s) $, sets of value functions $ \{v^k(a,s)\}_{k=1}^K $, and
decision rules $ \{c^k(s), \hat a^k(s)\}_{k=1}^K $ such
that

- The state-by-state borrowing constraints satisfy the recursion

$$
\bar A^k(s) = y^k(s) + \sum_{s'} Q(s'|s) \bar A^k(s')
$$

- For all $ k $, given
$ a^k_0 $, $ \bar A^k(s) $, and the pricing kernel, the value functions and decision rules
  solve the consumers’ problems;
- For all realizations of $ \{s*t\}*{t=0}^\infty $, the consumption and asset
portfolios $ \{\{c^k_t, $
$ \{\hat a^k*{t+1}(s')\}*{s'}\}_k\}\_t $ satisfy $ \sum_k c^k_t = \sum_k y^k(s_t) $ and
  $ \sum_k \hat a_{t+1}^k(s') = 0 $
  for all $ t $ and $ s' $.
- The initial financial wealth vector $ \vec a*0 $ satisfies $ \sum*{k=1}^K a_0^k = 0 $.

The third condition asserts that there are zero net aggregate claims in all Markov states.

The fourth condition asserts that the economy is closed and starts from a situation in which there
are zero net aggregate claims.

## State Variable Degeneracy

Please see Ljungqvist and Sargent [[Ljungqvist and Sargent, 2018](/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/References#id186)] for a description of
timing protocol for trades consistent with an Arrow-Debreu vision in which

- at time $ 0 $ there are complete markets in a complete menu of history $ s^t $-contingent claims on consumption at all dates that all trades occur at time zero
- all trades occur once and for all at time $ 0 $

If an allocation and pricing kernel $ Q $ in a recursive competitive equilibrium are to be
consistent
with the equilibrium allocation and price system that prevail in a corresponding complete markets economy with such history-contingent commodities and
all trades occurring at time $ 0 $,
we must impose that $ a_0^k = 0 $ for $ k = 1, \ldots , K $.

That is
what assures that at time $ 0 $ the present value of each agent’s consumption equals the present value of his endowment stream,
the single budget constraint in arrangement with all trades occurring at time $ 0 $.

Starting the system with $ a_0^k =0 $ for all $ i $ has a striking implication that we call **state variable degeneracy**.

Here is what we mean by **state variable degeneracy**:

Although two state variables $ a,s $ appear in the value function $ v^k(a,s) $, within a recursive competitive equilibrium starting from $ a_0^k = 0 \ \forall i $ at initial Markov state $ s_0 $, two outcomes prevail:

- $ a_0^k = 0 $ for all $ i $ whenever the Markov state $ s_t $ returns to $ s_0 $.
- Financial wealth $ a $ is an exact function of the Markov state $ s $.

The first finding asserts that each household recurrently visits the zero financial wealth state with which it began life.

The second finding asserts that within a competitive equilibrium the exogenous Markov state is all we require to track an individual.

Financial wealth turns out to be redundant because it is an exact function of the Markov state for each individual.

This outcome depends critically on there being complete markets in Arrow securities.

For example, it does not prevail in the incomplete markets setting of this lecture **The Aiyagari Model**

## Markov Asset Prices

Let’s start with a brief summary of formulas for computing asset prices in
a Markov setting.

The setup assumes the following infrastructure

- Markov states: $ s \in S = \left[\bar{s}_1, \ldots, \bar{s}_n \right] $ governed by an $ n $-state Markov chain with transition probability

$$
P_{ij} = \Pr \left\{s_{t+1} = \bar{s}_j \mid s_t = \bar{s}_i \right\}
$$

- A collection $ h=1,\ldots, H $ of $ n \times 1 $ vectors of $ H $ assets that pay off $ d^h\left(s\right) $ in state $ s $
- An $ n \times n $ matrix pricing kernel $ Q $ for one-period Arrow securities, where $ Q*{ij} $ = price at time $ t $ in state $ s_t =
  \bar s_i $ of one unit of consumption when $ s*{t+1} = \bar s_j $ at time $ t+1 $:

$$
Q_{ij} = {\textrm{Price}} \left\{s_{t+1} = \bar{s}_j \mid s_t = \bar{s}_i \right\}
$$

- The price of risk-free one-period bond in state $ i $ is $ R*i^{-1} = \sum*{j}Q\_{i,j} $
- The gross rate of return on a one-period risk-free bond Markov state $ \bar s*i $ is $ R_i = (\sum_j Q*{i,j})^{-1} $

### Exogenous Pricing Kernel

At this point, we’ll take the pricing kernel $ Q $ as exogenous, i.e., determined outside the model

Two examples would be

- $ Q = \beta P $ where $ \beta \in (0,1) $
- $ Q = S P $ where $ S $ is an $ n \times n $ matrix of _stochastic discount factors_

We’ll write down implications of Markov asset pricing in a nutshell for two types of assets

- the price in Markov state $ s $ at time $ t $ of a **cum dividend** stock that entitles the owner at the beginning of time $ t $ to the time $ t $ dividend and the option to sell the asset at time $ t+1 $. The price evidently satisfies $ p^h(\bar s*i) = d^h(\bar s_i) + \sum_j Q*{ij} p^h(\bar s_j) $, which implies that the vector $ p^h $ satisfies $ p^h = d^h + Q p^h $ which implies the formula

$$
p^h = (I - Q)^{-1} d^h
$$

- the price in Markov state $ s $ at time $ t $ of an **ex dividend** stock that entitles the owner at the end of time $ t $ to the time $ t+1 $ dividend and the option to sell the stock at time $ t+1 $. The price is

$$
p^h = (I - Q)^{-1} Q d^h
$$

> **Note**The matrix geometric sum $ (I - Q)^{-1} = I + Q + Q^2 + \cdots $
> is an example of a **resolvent operator**.

Below, we describe an equilibrium model with trading of one-period Arrow securities in which the pricing kernel is endogenous.

In constructing our model, we’ll repeatedly encounter formulas that remind us of our asset pricing formulas.

### Multi-Step-Forward Transition Probabilities and Pricing Kernels

The $ (i,j) $ component of the $ \ell $-step ahead transition probability $ P^\ell $ is

$$
Prob(s_{t+\ell} = \bar s_j | s_t = \bar s_i)   = P^{\ell}_{i,j}
$$

The $ (i,j) $ component of the $ \ell $-step ahead pricing kernel $ Q^\ell $ is

$$
Q^{(\ell)}(s_{t+\ell} = \bar s_j | s_t = \bar s_i)   = Q^{\ell}_{i,j}
$$

We’ll use these objects to state a useful property in asset pricing theory.

### Laws of Iterated Expectations and Iterated Values

A **law of iterated values** has a mathematical structure that parallels a
**law of iterated expectations**

We can describe its structure readily in the Markov setting of this lecture

Recall the following recursion satisfied by $ j $ step ahead transition probabilites
for our finite state Markov chain:

$$
P_j(s_{t+j}| s_t)  = \sum_{s_{t+1}} P_{j-1}(s_{t+j}| s_{t+1}) P(s_{t+1} | s_t)
$$

We can use this recursion to verify the law of iterated expectations applied
to computing the conditional expectation of a random variable $ d(s\_{t+j}) $ conditioned
on $ s_t $ via the following string of equalities

$$
\begin{aligned}
E \left[ E d(s_{t+j}) | s_{t+1} \right] | s_t
& = \sum_{s_{t+1}} \left[ \sum_{s_{t+j}} d(s_{t+j}) P_{j-1}(s_{t+j}| s_{t+1} ) \right]         P(s_{t+1} | s_t) \\
& = \sum_{s_{t+j}}  d(s_{t+j}) \left[ \sum_{s_{t+1}} P_{j-1} ( s_{t+j} |s_{t+1}) P(s_{t+1}| s_t) \right] \\
& = \sum_{s_{t+j}} d(s_{t+j}) P_j (s_{t+j} | s_t ) \\
& = E d(s_{t+j})| s_t
\end{aligned}
$$

The pricing kernel for $ j $ step ahead Arrow securities satisfies the recursion

$$
Q_j(s_{t+j}| s_t)  = \sum_{s_{t+1}} Q_{j-1}(s_{t+j}| s_{t+1}) Q(s_{t+1} | s_t)
$$

The time $ t $ **value** in Markov state $ s*t $ of a time $ t+j $ payout $ d(s*{t+j}) $
is

$$
V(d(s_{t+j})|s_t) = \sum_{s_{t+j}} d(s_{t+j}) Q_j(s_{t+j}| s_t)
$$

The **law of iterated values** states

$$
V \left[ V (d(s_{t+j}) | s_{t+1}) \right] | s_t  =   V(d(s_{t+j}))| s_t
$$

We verify it by pursuing the following a string of inequalities that are counterparts to those we used
to verify the law of iterated expectations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V \left[ V  ( d(s_{t+j}) | s_{t+1} ) \right] | s_t
& = \sum_{s_{t+1}} \left[ \sum_{s_{t+j}} d(s_{t+j}) Q_{j-1}(s_{t+j}| s_{t+1} ) \right]         Q(s_{t+1} | s_t) \\
& = \sum_{s_{t+j}}  d(s_{t+j}) \left[ \sum_{s_{t+1}} Q_{j-1} ( s_{t+j} |s_{t+1}) Q(s_{t+1}| s_t) \right] \\
& = \sum_{s_{t+j}} d(s_{t+j}) Q_j (s_{t+j} | s_t ) \\
& = E V(d(s_{t+j}))| s_t
\end{aligned}
$$

## General Equilibrium

Now we are ready to do some fun calculations.

We find it interesting to think in terms of analytical **inputs** into and **outputs** from our general equilibrium theorizing.

### Inputs

- Markov states: $ s \in S = \left[\bar{s}_1, \ldots, \bar{s}_n \right] $ governed by an $ n $-state Markov chain with transition probability

$$
P_{ij} = \Pr \left\{s_{t+1} = \bar{s}_j \mid s_t = \bar{s}_i \right\}
$$

- A collection of $ K \times 1 $ vectors of individual $ k $ endowments: $ y^k\left(s\right), k=1,\ldots, K $
- An $ n \times 1 $ vector of aggregate endowment: $ y\left(s\right) \equiv \sum\_{k=1}^K y^k\left(s\right) $
- A collection of $ K \times 1 $ vectors of individual $ k $ consumptions: $ c^k\left(s\right), k=1,\ldots, K $
- A collection of restrictions on feasible consumption allocations for $ s \in S $:

$$
c\left(s\right)= \sum_{k=1}^K c^k\left(s\right)
\leq  y\left(s\right)
$$

- Preferences: a common utility functional across agents $ E*0 \sum*{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u(c^k_t) $ with CRRA one-period utility function $ u\left(c\right) $ and discount factor $ \beta \in (0,1) $

The one-period utility function is

$$
u \left(c\right) = \frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}
$$

so that

$$
u^\prime \left(c\right) = c^{-\gamma}
$$

### Outputs

- An $ n \times n $ matrix pricing kernel $ Q $ for one-period Arrow securities, where $ Q*{ij} $ = price at time $ t $ in state $ s_t = \bar s_i $ of one unit of consumption when $ s*{t+1} = \bar s_j $ at time $ t+1 $
- pure exchange so that $ c\left(s\right) = y\left(s\right) $
- a $ K \times 1 $ vector distribution of wealth vector $ \alpha $, $ \alpha*k \geq 0, \sum*{k=1}^K \alpha_k =1 $
- A collection of $ n \times 1 $ vectors of individual $ k $ consumptions: $ c^k\left(s\right), k=1,\ldots, K $

### $ Q $ is the Pricing Kernel

For any agent $ k \in \left[1, \ldots, K\right] $, at the equilibrium allocation,
the one-period Arrow securities pricing kernel satisfies

$$
Q_{ij} = \beta \left(\frac{c^k\left(\bar{s}_j\right)}{c^k\left(\bar{s}_i\right)}\right)^{-\gamma} P_{ij}
$$

where $ Q $ is an $ n \times n $ matrix

This follows from agent $ k $’s first-order necessary conditions.

But with the CRRA preferences that we have assumed, individual consumptions vary proportionately
with aggregate consumption and therefore with the aggregate endowment.

- This is a consequence of our preference specification implying that **Engle curves** are affine in wealth and therefore satisfy conditions for **Gorman aggregation**

Thus,

$$
c^k \left(s\right) = \alpha_k c\left(s\right) = \alpha_k y\left(s\right)
$$

for an arbitrary **distribution of wealth** in the form of an $ K \times 1 $ vector $ \alpha $
that satisfies

$$
\alpha_k \in \left(0, 1\right), \quad \sum_{k=1}^K \alpha_k = 1
$$

This means that we can compute the pricing kernel from

$$
Q_{ij} = \beta \left(\frac{y_j}{y_i}\right)^{-\gamma} P_{ij} \tag{69.1}
$$

Note that $ Q\_{ij} $ is independent of vector $ \alpha $.

**Key finding:** We can compute competitive equilibrium **prices** prior to computing a **distribution of wealth**.

### Values

Having computed an equilibrium pricing kernel $ Q $, we can compute several **values** that are required
to pose or represent the solution of an individual household’s optimum problem.

We denote an $ K \times 1 $ vector of state-dependent values of agents’ endowments in Markov state $ s $ as

$$
A\left(s\right)=\left[\begin{array}{c}
A^{1}\left(s\right)\\
\vdots\\
A^{K}\left(s\right)
\end{array}\right], \quad s \in \left[\bar{s}_1, \ldots, \bar{s}_n\right]
$$

and an $ n \times 1 $ vector of continuation endowment values for each individual $ k $ as

$$
A^{k}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
A^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{1}\right)\\
\vdots\\
A^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{n}\right)
\end{array}\right], \quad k \in \left[1, \ldots, K\right]
$$

$ A^k $ of consumer $ k $ satisfies

$$
A^k = \left[I - Q\right]^{-1} \left[ y^k\right]
$$

where

$$
y^{k}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
y^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{1}\right)\\
\vdots\\
y^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{n}\right)
\end{array}\right] \equiv \begin{bmatrix} y^k_1 \cr \vdots \cr y^k_n \end{bmatrix}
$$

In a competitive equilibrium of an **infinite horizon** economy with sequential trading of one-period Arrow securities, $ A^k(s) $ serves as a state-by-state vector of **debt limits** on the quantities of one-period Arrow securities
paying off in state $ s $ at time $ t+1 $ that individual $ k $ can issue at time $ t $.

These are often called **natural debt limits**.

Evidently, they equal the maximum amount that it is feasible for individual $ k $ to repay
even if he consumes zero goods forevermore.

**Remark:** If we have an Inada condition at zero consumption or just impose that consumption
be nonnegative, then in a **finite horizon** economy with sequential trading of one-period Arrow securities there is no need to impose natural debt limits. See the section on a Finite Horizon Economy below.

### Continuation Wealth

Continuation wealth plays an important role in Bellmanizing a competitive equilibrium with sequential
trading of a complete set of one-period Arrow securities.

We denote an $ K \times 1 $ vector of state-dependent continuation wealths in Markov state $ s $ as

$$
\psi\left(s\right)=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\psi^{1}\left(s\right)\\
\vdots\\
\psi^{K}\left(s\right)
\end{array}\right], \quad s \in \left[\bar{s}_1, \ldots, \bar{s}_n\right]
$$

and an $ n \times 1 $ vector of continuation wealths for each individual $ k $ as

$$
\psi^{k}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\psi^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{1}\right)\\
\vdots\\
\psi^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{n}\right)
\end{array}\right], \quad k \in \left[1, \ldots, K\right]
$$

Continuation wealth $ \psi^k $ of consumer $ k $ satisfies

$$
\psi^k = \left[I - Q\right]^{-1} \left[\alpha_k y - y^k\right] \tag{69.2}
$$

where

$$
y^{k}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
y^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{1}\right)\\
\vdots\\
y^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{n}\right)
\end{array}\right],\quad y=\left[\begin{array}{c}
y\left(\bar{s}_{1}\right)\\
\vdots\\
y\left(\bar{s}_{n}\right)
\end{array}\right]
$$

Note that $ \sum*{k=1}^K \psi^k = {0}*{n \times 1} $.

**Remark:** At the initial state $ s_0 \in \begin{bmatrix} \bar s_1, \ldots, \bar s_n \end{bmatrix} $,
the continuation wealth $ \psi^k(s_0) = 0 $ for all agents $ k = 1, \ldots, K $. This indicates that
the economy begins with all agents being debt-free and financial-asset-free at time $ 0 $, state $ s_0 $.

**Remark:** Note that all agents’ continuation wealths recurrently return to zero when the Markov state returns to whatever value $ s_0 $ it had at time $ 0 $.

### Optimal Portfolios

A nifty feature of the model is that an optimal portfolio of a type $ k $ agent equals the continuation wealth that we just computed.

Thus, agent $ k $’s state-by-state purchases of Arrow securities next period depend only on next period’s
Markov state and equal

$$
a_k(s) = \psi^k(s), \quad s \in \left[\bar s_1, \ldots, \bar s_n \right] \tag{69.3}
$$

### Equilibrium Wealth Distribution $ \alpha $

With the initial state being a particular state $ s_0 \in \left[\bar{s}_1, \ldots, \bar{s}_n\right] $,
we must have

$$
\psi^k\left(s_0\right) = 0, \quad k=1, \ldots, K
$$

which means the equilibrium distribution of wealth satisfies

$$
\alpha_k = \frac{V_z y^k}{V_z y} \tag{69.4}
$$

where $ V \equiv \left[I - Q\right]^{-1} $ and $ z $ is the row index corresponding to the initial state $ s_0 $.

Since $ \sum*{k=1}^K V_z y^k = V_z y $, $ \sum*{k=1}^K \alpha_k = 1 $.

In summary, here is the logical flow of an algorithm to compute a competitive equilibrium:

- compute $ Q $ from the aggregate allocation and formula [(69.1)](#equation-eq-qformula)
- compute the distribution of wealth $ \alpha $ from the formula [(69.4)](#equation-eqn-alphakform)
- Using $ \alpha $ assign each consumer $ k $ the share $ \alpha_k $ of the aggregate endowment at each state
- return to the $ \alpha $-dependent formula [(69.2)](#equation-eq-continwealth) and compute continuation wealths
- via formula [(69.3)](#equation-eqn-optport) equate agent $ k $’s portfolio to its continuation wealth state by state

We can also add formulas for optimal value functions in a competitive equilibrium with trades
in a complete set of one-period state-contingent Arrow securities.

Call the optimal value functions $ J^k $ for consumer $ k $.

For the infinite horizon economy now under study, the formula is

$$
J^k = (I - \beta P)^{-1} u(\alpha_k y)  , \quad u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}
$$

where it is understood that $ u(\alpha_k y) $ is a vector.

## Finite Horizon

We now describe a finite-horizon version of the economy that operates for $ T+1 $ periods
$ t \in {\bf T} = \{ 0, 1, \ldots, T\} $.

Consequently, we’ll want $ T+1 $ counterparts to objects described above, with one important exception:
we won’t need **borrowing limits**.

- borrowing limits aren’t required for a finite horizon economy in which a
  one-period utility function $ u(c) $ satisfies an Inada condition that sets the marginal utility of consumption at zero consumption to zero.
- Nonnegativity of consumption choices at all $ t \in {\bf T} $ automatically
  limits borrowing.

### Continuation Wealths

We denote a $ K \times 1 $ vector of state-dependent continuation wealths in Markov state $ s $ at time $ t $ as

$$
\psi_t\left(s\right)=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\psi^{1}\left(s\right)\\
\vdots\\
\psi^{K}\left(s\right)
\end{array}\right], \quad s \in \left[\bar{s}_1, \ldots, \bar{s}_n\right]
$$

and an $ n \times 1 $ vector of continuation wealths for each individual $ k $ as

$$
\psi_t^{k}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\psi_t^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{1}\right)\\
\vdots\\
\psi_t^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{n}\right)
\end{array}\right], \quad k \in \left[1, \ldots, K\right]
$$

Continuation wealths $ \psi^k $ of consumer $ k $ satisfy

$$
\begin{aligned}
\psi_T^k & =  \left[\alpha_k y - y^k\right] \cr
\psi_{T-1}^k & =  \left[I + Q \right] \left[\alpha_k y - y^k\right] \cr
\vdots \quad  & \quad \quad \quad \vdots \cr
\psi_0^k  & = \left[I + Q + Q^2 + \cdots + Q^T \right] \left[\alpha_k y - y^k\right]
\end{aligned} \tag{69.5}
$$

where

$$
y^{k}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
y^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{1}\right)\\
\vdots\\
y^{k}\left(\bar{s}_{n}\right)
\end{array}\right],\quad y=\left[\begin{array}{c}
y\left(\bar{s}_{1}\right)\\
\vdots\\
y\left(\bar{s}_{n}\right)
\end{array}\right]
$$

Note that $ \sum*{k=1}^K \psi_t^k = {0}*{n \times 1} $ for all $ t \in {\bf T} $.

**Remark:** At the initial state $ s_0 \in \begin{bmatrix} \bar s_1, \ldots, \bar s_n \end{bmatrix} $,
for all agents $ k = 1, \ldots, K $, continuation wealth $ \psi_0^k(s_0) = 0 $. This indicates that
the economy begins with all agents being debt-free and financial-asset-free at time $ 0 $, state $ s_0 $.

**Remark:** Note that all agents’ continuation wealths return to zero when the Markov state returns to whatever value $ s_0 $ it had at time $ 0 $. This will recur if the Markov chain makes the initial state $ s_0 $ recurrent.

With the initial state being a particular state $ s_0 \in \left[\bar{s}_1, \ldots, \bar{s}_n\right] $, we must have

$$
\psi_0^k\left(s_0\right) = 0, \quad k=1, \ldots, K
$$

which means the equilibrium distribution of wealth satisfies

$$
\alpha_k = \frac{V_z y^k}{V_z y} \tag{69.6}
$$

where now in our finite-horizon economy

$$
V = \left[I + Q + Q^2 + \cdots + Q^T \right] \tag{69.7}
$$

and $ z $ is the row index corresponding to the initial state $ s_0 $.

Since $ \sum*{k=1}^K V_z y^k = V_z y $, $ \sum*{k=1}^K \alpha_k = 1 $.

In summary, here is the logical flow of an algorithm to compute a competitive equilibrium with Arrow securities
in our finite-horizon Markov economy:

- compute $ Q $ from the aggregate allocation and formula [(69.1)](#equation-eq-qformula)
- compute the distribution of wealth $ \alpha $ from formulas [(69.6)](#equation-eq-w) and [(69.7)](#equation-eq-ww)
- using $ \alpha $, assign each consumer $ k $ the share $ \alpha_k $ of the aggregate endowment at each state
- return to the $ \alpha $-dependent formula [(69.5)](#equation-eq-vv) for continuation wealths and compute continuation wealths
- equate agent $ k $’s portfolio to its continuation wealth state by state

While for the infinite horizon economy, the formula for value functions is

$$
J^k = (I - \beta P)^{-1} u(\alpha_k y)  , \quad u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}
$$

for the finite horizon economy the formula is

$$
J_0^k = (I + \beta P + \cdots + \beta^T P^T) u(\alpha_k y) ,
$$

where it is understood that $ u(\alpha_k y) $ is a vector.

## Python Code

We are ready to dive into some Python code.

As usual, we start with Python imports.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)
```

First, we create a Python class to compute the objects that comprise a competitive equilibrium
with sequential trading of one-period Arrow securities.

In addition to infinite-horizon economies, the code is set up to handle finite-horizon economies indexed by horizon $ T $.

We’ll study examples of finite horizon economies after we first look at some infinite-horizon economies.

## Examples

We’ll use our code to construct equilibrium objects in several example economies.

Our first several examples will be infinite horizon economies.

Our final example will be a finite horizon economy.

### Example 1

Please read the preceding class for default parameter values and the following Python code for the fundamentals of the economy.

Here goes.

```python
# dimensions
K, n = 2, 2

# states
s = np.array([0, 1])

# transition
P = np.array([[.5, .5], [.5, .5]])

# endowments
ys = np.empty((n, K))
ys[:, 0] = 1 - s       # y1
ys[:, 1] = s           # y2
```

```python
ex1 = RecurCompetitive(s, P, ys)
```

```python
# endowments
ex1.ys
```

    array([[1., 0.],
           [0., 1.]])

```python
# pricing kernal
ex1.Q
```

    array([[0.49, 0.49],
           [0.49, 0.49]])

```python
# Risk free rate R
ex1.R
```

    array([1.02040816, 1.02040816])

```python
# natural debt limit, A = [A1, A2, ..., AI]
ex1.A
```

    array([[25.5, 24.5],
           [24.5, 25.5]])

```python
# when the initial state is state 1
print(f'α = {ex1.wealth_distribution(s0_idx=0)}')
print(f'ψ = \n{ex1.continuation_wealths()}')
print(f'J = \n{ex1.value_functionss()}')
```

    α = [0.51 0.49]
    ψ =
    [[[-0.  0.]
      [ 1. -1.]]]
    J =
    [[[71.41428429 70.        ]
      [71.41428429 70.        ]]]

```python
# when the initial state is state 2
print(f'α = {ex1.wealth_distribution(s0_idx=1)}')
print(f'ψ = \n{ex1.continuation_wealths()}')
print(f'J = \n{ex1.value_functionss()}')
```

    α = [0.49 0.51]
    ψ =
    [[[-1.  1.]
      [ 0. -0.]]]
    J =
    [[[70.         71.41428429]
      [70.         71.41428429]]]

### Example 2

```python
# dimensions
K, n = 2, 2

# states
s = np.array([1, 2])

# transition
P = np.array([[.5, .5], [.5, .5]])

# endowments
ys = np.empty((n, K))
ys[:, 0] = 1.5         # y1
ys[:, 1] = s           # y2
```

```python
ex2 = RecurCompetitive(s, P, ys)
```

```python
# endowments

print("ys = \n", ex2.ys)

# pricing kernal
print ("Q = \n", ex2.Q)

# Risk free rate R
print("R = ", ex2.R)
```

    ys =
     [[1.5 1. ]
     [1.5 2. ]]
    Q =
     [[0.49       0.41412558]
     [0.57977582 0.49      ]]
    R =  [0.93477529 1.10604104]

```python
# pricing kernal
ex2.Q
```

    array([[0.49      , 0.41412558],
           [0.57977582, 0.49      ]])

Note that the pricing kernal in example economies 1 and 2 differ.

This comes from differences in the aggregate endowments in state 1 and 2 in example 1.

```python
ex2.β * ex2.u_prime(3.5) / ex2.u_prime(2.5) * ex2.P[0,1]
```

    0.4141255848169731

```python
ex2.β * ex2.u_prime(2.5) / ex2.u_prime(3.5) * ex2.P[1,0]
```

    0.5797758187437624

```python
# Risk free rate R

```

    array([0.93477529, 1.10604104])

```

    α = [0.50879763 0.49120237]
    ψ =

### Example 3

```python
# dimensions
K, n = 2, 2

# states
s = np.array([1, 2])

# transition
λ = 0.9
P = np.array([[1-λ, λ], [0, 1]])

# endowments
ys = np.empty((n, K))
ys[:, 0] = [1, 0]         # y1
ys[:, 1] = [0, 1]         # y2
```

```python
ex3 = RecurCompetitive(s, P, ys)
```

```python
# endowments

print("ys = ", ex3.ys)

# pricing kernel
print ("Q = ", ex3.Q)

# Risk free rate R
print("R = ", ex3.R)
```

    ys =  [[1. 0.]
     [0. 1.]]
    Q =  [[0.098 0.882]
     [0.    0.98 ]]
    R =  [10.20408163  0.53705693]

```python
# pricing kernel
ex3.Q
```

    array([[0.098, 0.882],
           [0.   , 0.98 ]])

```python
# natural debt limit, A = [A1, A2, ..., AI]
ex3.A
```

    array([[ 1.10864745, 48.89135255],
           [ 0.        , 50.        ]])

Note that the natural debt limit for agent $ 1 $ in state $ 2 $ is $ 0 $.

```python
# when the initial state is state 1
print(f'α = {ex3.wealth_distribution(s0_idx=0)}')
print(f'ψ = \n{ex3.continuation_wealths()}')
print(f'J = \n{ex3.value_functionss()}')
```

    α = [0.02217295 0.97782705]
    ψ =
    [[[ 0.         -0.        ]
      [ 1.10864745 -1.10864745]]]
    J =
    [[[14.89058394 98.88513796]
      [14.89058394 98.88513796]]]

```python
# when the initial state is state 1
print(f'α = {ex3.wealth_distribution(s0_idx=1)}')
print(f'ψ = \n{ex3.continuation_wealths()}')
print(f'J = \n{ex3.value_functionss()}')
```

    α = [0. 1.]
    ψ =
    [[[-1.10864745  1.10864745]

    J =
    [[[  0. 100.]
      [  0. 100.]]]

For the specification of the Markov chain in example 3, let’s take a look at how the equilibrium allocation changes as a function of transition probability $ \lambda $.

```python
λ_seq = np.linspace(0, 0.99, 100)

# prepare containers
αs0_seq = np.empty((len(λ_seq), 2))
αs1_seq = np.empty((len(λ_seq), 2))

for i, λ in enumerate(λ_seq):
    P = np.array([[1-λ, λ], [0, 1]])
    ex3 = RecurCompetitive(s, P, ys)

    # initial state s0 = 1
    α = ex3.wealth_distribution(s0_idx=0)
    αs0_seq[i, :] = α

    # initial state s0 = 2
    α = ex3.wealth_distribution(s0_idx=1)
    αs1_seq[i, :] = α
```

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))

for i, αs_seq in enumerate([αs0_seq, αs1_seq]):
    for j in range(2):
        axs[i].plot(λ_seq, αs_seq[:, j], label=f'α{j+1}')
        axs[i].set_xlabel('λ')
        axs[i].set_title(f'initial state s0 = {s[i]}')
        axs[i].legend()

plt.show()
```

### Finite Horizon Example

We now revisit the economy defined in example 1, but set the time horizon to be $ T=10 $.

```python
# dimensions
K, n = 2, 2

# states
s = np.array([0, 1])

# transition
P = np.array([[.5, .5], [.5, .5]])

# endowments
ys = np.empty((n, K))
ys[:, 0] = 1 - s       # y1
ys[:, 1] = s           # y2
```

```python
ex1_finite = RecurCompetitive(s, P, ys, T=10)
```

```python
# (I + Q + Q^2 + ... + Q^T)
ex1_finite.V[-1]
```

    array([[5.48171623, 4.48171623],
           [4.48171623, 5.48171623]])

```python
# endowments
ex1_finite.ys
```

    array([[1., 0.],
           [0., 1.]])

```python
# pricing kernal
ex1_finite.Q
```

    array([[0.49, 0.49],
           [0.49, 0.49]])

```python
# Risk free rate R
ex1_finite.R
```

    array([1.02040816, 1.02040816])

In the finite time horizon case, `ψ` and `J` are returned as sequences.

Components are ordered from $ t=T $ to $ t=0 $.

```python
# when the initial state is state 2
print(f'α = {ex1_finite.wealth_distribution(s0_idx=0)}')
print(f'ψ = \n{ex1_finite.continuation_wealths()}\n')
print(f'J = \n{ex1_finite.value_functionss()}')
```
