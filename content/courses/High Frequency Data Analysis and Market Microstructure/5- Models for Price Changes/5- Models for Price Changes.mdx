## Models for Price Changes

The discreteness and concentration on “no change” make it difficult to model the intraday price changes. Campbell et al. (1997) discuss several econometric models for price changes that have been proposed in the literature. Here we mention two models that have the advantage of employing explanatory variables to study the intraday price movements. The first model is the ordered probit model used by Hauseman, Lo, and MacKinlay (1992) to study the price movements in transactions data. The second model has been considered recently by McCulloch and Tsay (2000) and is a simplified version of the model proposed by Rydberg and Shephard (2003); see also Ghysels (2000).
