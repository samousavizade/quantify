An alternative approach to modeling price change is to decompose it into three components and use conditional specifications for the components; see Rydberg and Shephard (2003). The three components are an indicator for price change, the direction of price movement if there is a change, and the size of price change if a change occurs. Specifically, the price change at the $i$th transaction can be written as

$$
y_i \equiv P_t - P_{t-1} = A_i D_i S_i,
$$

where $A_i$ is a binary variable defined as:

$$
A_i =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if there is a price change at the } i\text{th trade}, \\
0 & \text{if price remains the same at the } i\text{th trade},
\end{cases}
$$

$D_i$ is also a discrete variable signifying the direction of the price change if a change occurs, that is,

$$
D_i|(A_i = 1) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if price increases at the } i\text{th trade}, \\
-1 & \text{if price drops at the } i\text{th trade},
\end{cases}
$$

where $D_i |(A_i = 1)$ means that $D_i$ is defined under the condition of $A_i = 1$, and $S_i$ is the size of the price change in ticks if there is a change at the $i$th trade and $S_i = 0$ if there is no price change at the $i$th trade. When there is a price change, $S_i$ is a positive integer-valued random variable.

Note that $D_i$ is not needed when $A_i = 0$, and there is a natural ordering in the decomposition. $D_i$ is well defined only when $A_i = 1$ and $S_i$ is meaningful when $A_i = 1$ and $D_i$ is given. Model specification under the decomposition makes use of the ordering.

Let $F*i$ be the information set available at the $i$th transaction. Examples of elements in $F_i$ are $t*{i-j}$, $A*{i-j}$, $D*{i-j}$, and $S_{i-j}$ for $j \geq 0$. The evolution of price change under model (5.21) can then be partitioned as

$$
P(y_i|F_{i-1}) = P(A_i D_i S_i|F_{i-1}) = P(S_i|D_i,A_i,F_{i-1})P(D_i|A_i,F_{i-1})P(A_i|F_{i-1}).
$$

Since $A_i$ is a binary variable, it suffices to consider the evolution of the probability $p_i = P(A_i = 1)$ over time. We assume that

$$
\ln\left(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\right) = x_i \beta
$$

where $x_i$ is a finite-dimensional vector consisting of elements of $\mathcal{F}_{i-1}$ and $\beta$ is a parameter vector. Conditioned on $A_i = 1$, $D_i$ is also a binary variable, and we use the following model for $\delta_i = P(D_i = 1|A_i = 1)$:

$$
\ln\left(\frac{\delta_i}{1-\delta_i}\right) = z_i \gamma
$$

where $z_i$ is a finite-dimensional vector consisting of elements of $\mathcal{F}_{i-1}$ and $\gamma$ is a parameter vector. To allow for asymmetry between positive and negative price changes, we assume that

$$
\ln\left(\frac{\lambda_{j,i}}{1-\lambda_{j,i}}\right) = w_i \theta_j \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda_{j,i} = \frac{e^{w_i \theta_j}}{1 + e^{w_i \theta_j}}, \quad j=u,d,
$$

$$
\ln\left(\frac{\delta_i}{1-\delta_i}\right) = z_i \gamma \quad \text{or} \quad \delta_i = \frac{e^{z_i \gamma}}{1 + e^{z_i \gamma}},
$$

$$
\ln\left(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\right) = x_i \beta \quad \text{or} \quad p_i = \frac{e^{x_i \beta}}{1 + e^{x_i \beta}}
$$

$$
S_i|(D_i,A_i = 1) \sim
\begin{cases}
g(\lambda_{u,i}) & \text{if } D_i = 1, A_i = 1, \\
g(\lambda_{d,i}) & \text{if } D_i = -1, A_i = 1,
\end{cases}
$$

where $g(\lambda)$ is a geometric distribution with parameter $\lambda$ and the parameters $\lambda_{j,i}$ evolve over time as

$$
w_i
$$

where $w_i$ is again a finite-dimensional explanatory variable in $\mathcal{F}_{i-1}$ and $\theta_j$ is a parameter vector.

In Eq. (5.27), the probability mass function of a random variable $x$, which follows the geometric distribution $g(\lambda)$, is

$$
p(x = m) = \lambda(1 - \lambda)^m, \quad m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots.
$$

We added 1 to the geometric distribution so that the price change, if it occurs, is at least 1 tick. In Eq. (5.28), we take the logistic transformation to ensure that $\lambda_{j,i} \in [0,1]$.

The previous specification classifies the $i$th trade, or transaction, into one of three categories:

1. No price change: $A_i = 0$ and the associated probability is $(1 - p_i)$.
2. A price increase: $A_i = 1$, $D_i = 1$, and the associated probability is $p_i \delta_i$. The size of the price increase is governed by $1 + g(\lambda_{u,i})$.
3. A price drop: $A_i = 1$, $D_i = -1$, and the associated probability is $p_i (1 - \delta_i)$. The size of the price drop is governed by $1 + g(\lambda_{d,i})$.

Let $I_i(j)$ for $j = 1, 2, 3$ be the indicator variables of the prior three categories. That is, $I_i(j) = 1$ if the $j$th category occurs and $I_i(j) = 0$ otherwise. The log-likelihood function of Eq. (5.24) becomes

$$
\ln[P(y_i|F_{i-1})] = I_i(1)\ln[(1-p_i)] + I_i(2)[\ln(p_i)+\ln(\delta_i) + \ln(\lambda_{u,i})+(S_i -1)\ln(1-\lambda_{u,i})] + I_i(3)[\ln(p_i)+\ln(1-\delta_i)+\ln(\lambda_{d,i})+(S_i -1)\ln(1-\lambda_{d,i})],
$$

and the overall log-likelihood function is

$$
\ln[P(y_1,\ldots,y_n|F_0)] = \sum_{i=1}^n \ln[P(y_i|F_{i-1})],
$$

which is a function of parameters $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\theta_u$, and $\theta_d$.

**Example 5.2.** We illustrate the decomposition model by analyzing the intraday transactions of IBM stock from November 1, 1990, to January 31, 1991. There were 63 trading days and 59,838 intraday transactions in the normal trading hours. The explanatory variables used are:

1. $A_{i-1}$: the action indicator of the previous trade [i.e., the $(i - 1)$th trade within a trading day]
2. $D_{i-1}$: the direction indicator of the previous trade
3. $S_{i-1}$: the size of the previous trade
4. $V_{i-1}$: the volume of the previous trade, divided by 1000
5. $t_{i-1}$: time duration from the $(i - 2)$th to $(i - 1)$th trade
6. $BA_i$: the bid–ask spread prevailing at the time of transaction

Because we use lag-1 explanatory variables, the actual sample size is 59,775. It turns out that $V_{i-1}$, $t_{i-1}$, and $BA_i$ are not statistically significant for the model entertained. Thus, only the first three explanatory variables are used. The model employed is

$$
\begin{align*}
\ln \frac{p_i}{1-p_i} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1A_{i-1}, \\
\ln \frac{\delta_i}{1-\delta_i} &= \gamma_0 + \gamma_1D_{i-1}, \\
\ln \frac{\lambda_{u,i}}{1-\lambda_{u,i}} &= \theta_{u,0} + \theta_{u,1}S_{i-1},\\
\ln \frac{\lambda_{d,i}}{1-\lambda_{d,i}} &= \theta_{d,0} + \theta_{d,1}S_{i-1}.
\end{align*}
$$

The parameter estimates, using the log-likelihood function in Eq. (5.29), are given in Table 5.6. The estimated simple model shows some dynamic dependence in the price change. In particular, the trade-by-trade price changes of IBM stock exhibit some appealing features:

1. The probability of a price change depends on the previous price change. Specifically, we have
   $$P(A_i = 1|A_{i−1} = 0) = 0.258, \quad P(A_i = 1|A_{i−1} = 1) = 0.476.$$
   The result indicates that a price change may occur in clusters and, as expected, most transactions are without price change. When no price change occurred at the $(i − 1)$th trade, then only about one out of four trades in the subsequent transaction has a price change. When there is a price change at the $(i − 1)$th transaction, the probability of a price change in the $i$th trade increases to about 0.5.

2. The direction of price change is governed by

   $$
   P(D_i = 1|F_{i−1},A_i)=\begin{cases}
   0.483 & \text{if } D_{i−1} = 0 \text{ (i.e., } A_{i−1} = 0),\\
   0.085 & \text{if } D_{i−1} = 1, A_i = 1,\\
   0.904 & \text{if } D_{i−1} = −1, A_i = 1.
   \end{cases}
   $$

   This result says that (a) if no price change occurred at the $(i − 1)$th trade, then the chances for a price increase or decrease at the $i$th trade are about even; and (b) the probabilities of consecutive price increases or decreases are very low. The probability of a price increase at the $i$th trade given that a price change occurs at the $i$th trade and there was a price increase at the $(i − 1)$th trade is only 8.6%. However, the probability of a price increase is about 90% given that a price change occurs at the $i$th trade and there was a price decrease at the $(i − 1)$th trade. Consequently, this result shows the effect of bid–ask bounce and supports price reversals in high-frequency trading.

3. There is weak evidence suggesting that big price changes have a higher probability to be followed by another big price change. Consider the size of A price increase. We have

   $$
   S_i \mid (D_i = 1) \sim 1 + g(\lambda_{u,i}), \quad \lambda_{u,i} = 2.235 - 0.670 S_{i-1}.
   $$

   Using the probability mass function of a geometric distribution, we obtain that the probability of a price increase by one tick is 0.827 at the $i$th trade if the transaction results in a price increase and $S_{i-1} = 1$. The probability reduces to 0.709 if $S_{i-1} = 2$ and to 0.556 if $S_{i-1} = 3$. Consequently, the probability of a large $S_i$ is proportional to $S_{i-1}$ given that there is a price increase at the $i$th trade.

A difference between the ADS of Eq. (5.21) and ordered probit models is that the former does not require any truncation or grouping in the size of a price change.
