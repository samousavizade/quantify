## Processes Considered

Besides the return series, we also consider the volatility process and the behavior of extreme returns of an asset. The volatility process is concerned with the evolution of conditional variance of the return over time. This is a topic of interest because, the variabilities of returns vary over time and appear in clusters. In application, volatility plays an important role in pricing options and risk management.

By extremes of a return series, we mean the large positive or negative returns. The minimum and maximum of a return series can be substantial. The negative extreme returns are important in risk management, whereas positive extreme returns are critical to holding a short position. We study properties and applications of extreme returns, such as the frequency of occurrence, the size of an extreme, and the impacts of economic variables on the extremes, in Chapter 7.
