## Asset Returns

Most financial studies involve returns, instead of prices, of assets. There are two main reasons for using returns:

1. For average investors, return of an asset is a complete and scale-free summary of the investment opportunity.

2. Return series are easier to handle than price series because they have more attractive statistical properties.

There are several definitions of asset returns that are commonly used:

### One-Period Simple Return

Let $P_t$ be the price of an asset at time index $t$. Holding the asset for one period from date $t-1$ to date $t$ would result in a simple gross return:

$$1 + R_t = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}$$

or

$$P_t = P_{t-1}(1 + R_t)$$

The corresponding one-period simple net return or simple return is:

$$R_t = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1 = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$$

### Multiperiod Simple Return

Holding the asset for $k$ periods between dates $t-k$ and $t$ gives a $k$-period simple gross return:

$$1 + R_t[k] = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-k}} = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} \times \frac{P_{t-1}}{P_{t-2}} \times \cdots \times \frac{P_{t-k+1}}{P_{t-k}} = (1 + R_t)(1 + R_{t-1}) \cdots (1 + R_{t-k+1}) = \prod_{j=0}^{k-1} (1 + R_{t-j})$$

Thus, the $k$-period simple gross return is just the product of the $k$ one-period simple gross returns involved. This is called a compound return.

The $k$-period simple net return is:

$$R_t[k] = (P_t - P_{t-k})/P_{t-k}$$

If the asset was held for $k$ years, then the annualized (average) return is defined as:

$$\text{Annualized } \{R_t[k]\} = \left[\prod_{j=0}^{k-1} (1 + R_{t-j})\right]^{1/k} - 1$$

This is a geometric mean of the $k$ one-period simple gross returns involved and can be computed by:

$$\text{Annualized } \{R_t[k]\} = \exp\left(\frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \ln(1 + R_{t-j})\right) - 1$$

where $\exp(x)$ denotes the exponential function and $\ln(x)$ is the natural logarithm of the positive number $x$.

Because it is easier to compute arithmetic average than geometric mean and the one-period returns tend to be small, one can use a first-order Taylor expansion to approximate the annualized return:

$$\text{Annualized } \{R_t[k]\} \approx \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} R_{t-j}$$

However, accuracy of this approximation may not be sufficient in some applications.

### Continuous Compounding

Before introducing continuously compounded return, we discuss the effect of compounding. Assume that the interest rate of a bank deposit is 10% per annum and the initial deposit is $1.00. If the bank pays interest once a year, then the net value of the deposit becomes $1(1 + 0.1) = $1.1 one year later. If the bank pays interest semiannually, the 6-month interest rate is 10%/2 = 5% and the net value is $1(1 + 0.1/2)^2 = $1.1025 after the first year.

In general, if the bank pays interest $m$ times a year, then the interest rate for each payment is 10%/$m$ and the net value of the deposit becomes $1(1 + 0.1/m)^m$ one year later. As $m$ increases, the net value approaches $1.1052, which is obtained by $\exp(0.1)$ and referred to as the result of continuous compounding.

In general, the net asset value $A$ of continuous compounding is:

$$A = C \exp(r \times n)$$

where $r$ is the interest rate per annum, $C$ is the initial capital, and $n$ is the number of years.

From this, we have:

$$C = A \exp(-r \times n)$$

which is referred to as the present value of an asset that is worth $A$ dollars $n$ years from now, assuming that the continuously compounded interest rate is $r$ per annum.

### Continuously Compounded Return

The natural logarithm of the simple gross return of an asset is called the continuously compounded return or log return:

$$r_t = \ln(1 + R_t) = \ln\left(\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\right) = p_t - p_{t-1}$$

where $p_t = \ln(P_t)$.

Continuously compounded returns $r_t$ enjoy some advantages over the simple net returns $R_t$. For multiperiod returns:

$$r_t[k] = \ln(1 + R_t[k]) = \ln[(1 + R_t)(1 + R_{t-1}) \cdots (1 + R_{t-k+1})] = \ln(1 + R_t) + \ln(1 + R_{t-1}) + \cdots + \ln(1 + R_{t-k+1}) = r_t + r_{t-1} + \cdots + r_{t-k+1}$$

Thus, the continuously compounded multiperiod return is simply the sum of continuously compounded one-period returns involved.

### Portfolio Return

The simple net return of a portfolio consisting of $N$ assets is a weighted average of the simple net returns of the assets involved, where the weight on each asset is the percentage of the portfolio's value invested in that asset. Let $p$ be a portfolio that places weight $w_i$ on asset $i$. Then the simple return of $p$ at time $t$ is:

$$R_{p,t} = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i R_{it}$$

where $R_{it}$ is the simple return of asset $i$.

The continuously compounded returns of a portfolio, however, do not have this convenient property. If the simple returns $R_{it}$ are all small in magnitude, then we have:

$$r_{p,t} \approx \sum_{i=1}^N w_i r_{it}$$

where $r_{p,t}$ is the continuously compounded return of the portfolio at time $t$. This approximation is often used to study portfolio returns.

### Dividend Payment

If an asset pays dividends periodically, we must modify the definitions of asset returns. Let $D_t$ be the dividend payment of an asset between dates $t-1$ and $t$ and $P_t$ be the price of the asset at the end of period $t$. Thus, dividend is not included in $P_t$. Then the simple net return and continuously compounded return at time $t$ become:

$$R_t = \frac{P_t + D_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1$$

$$r_t = \ln(P_t + D_t) - \ln(P_{t-1})$$

### Excess Return

Excess return of an asset at time $t$ is the difference between the asset's return and the return on some reference asset. The reference asset is often taken to be riskless such as a short-term U.S. Treasury bill return. The simple excess return and log excess return of an asset are then defined as:

$$Z_t = R_t - R_{0t}$$

$$z_t = r_t - r_{0t}$$

where $R_{0t}$ and $r_{0t}$ are the simple and log returns of the reference asset, respectively.

In the finance literature, the excess return is thought of as the payoff on an arbitrage portfolio that goes long in an asset and short in the reference asset with no net initial investment.
