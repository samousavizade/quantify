## Simple AR Models

Autoregressive (AR) models are fundamental tools in time series analysis, particularly useful for modeling financial data. They capture the linear dependencies between a variable and its lagged values. This section explores the properties, identification, estimation, and forecasting of simple AR models.

### Properties of AR Models

#### AR(1) Model

An autoregressive model of order 1, denoted as AR(1), is defined as:

$$

r_t = \phi_0 + \phi_1 r_{t-1} + a_t
$$

where $\{a_t\}$ is a white noise series with mean zero and variance $\sigma_a^2$. The model implies that the current value $r_t$ depends linearly on its immediate past value $r_{t-1}$ and a random shock $a_t$.

**Stationarity Condition:**

For the AR(1) model to be weakly stationary, the absolute value of the autoregressive parameter must be less than one:

$$

|\phi_1| < 1
$$

This condition ensures that the influence of past values diminishes over time.

**Mean and Variance:**

Under stationarity, the mean and variance of $r_t$ are given by:

$$

E(r_t) = \mu = \frac{\phi_0}{1 - \phi_1}
$$

$$

Var(r_t) = \frac{\sigma_a^2}{1 - \phi_1^2}
$$

**Autocorrelation Function (ACF):**

The autocorrelation function for an AR(1) model decays exponentially:

$$

\rho_\ell = \phi_1^\ell
$$

for $\ell \geq 0$. This property allows us to identify AR(1) models by examining the pattern of decay in the sample ACF.

#### AR(2) Model

An autoregressive model of order 2, denoted as AR(2), is defined as:

$$

r_t = \phi_0 + \phi_1 r_{t-1} + \phi_2 r_{t-2} + a_t
$$

**Stationarity Condition:**

For stationarity, the roots of the characteristic equation must lie outside the unit circle:

$$

1 - \phi_1 x - \phi_2 x^2 = 0
$$

**Mean and Variance:**

The mean of an AR(2) process is:

$$

E(r_t) = \mu = \frac{\phi_0}{1 - \phi_1 - \phi_2}
$$

**Autocorrelation Function (ACF):**

The ACF satisfies a second-order difference equation:

$$

\rho_\ell = \phi_1 \rho_{\ell-1} + \phi_2 \rho_{\ell-2}
$$

for $\ell > 0$. The behavior of the ACF depends on the nature of the roots of the characteristic equation.

### Identifying AR Models in Practice

#### Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)

The PACF is used to identify the order $p$ of an AR model. For an AR($p$) process, the PACF cuts off after lag $p$. This means that for lags greater than $p$, the PACF values should be approximately zero.

#### Information Criteria

Information criteria such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are used to determine the optimal order $p$:

- **AIC:**

$$

AIC(p) = \ln(\hat{\sigma}^2_p) + \frac{2p}{T}
$$

- **BIC:**

$$

BIC(p) = \ln(\hat{\sigma}^2_p) + \frac{p\ln(T)}{T}
$$

where $\hat{\sigma}^2_p$ is the estimated variance of residuals for an AR($p$) model, and $T$ is the sample size.

### Estimation

Parameters of an AR model can be estimated using conditional least squares or maximum likelihood estimation. The estimates are obtained by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.

### Forecasting

Forecasting with AR models involves predicting future values based on past observations. For an AR($p$) model, forecasts are computed recursively using:

#### One-Step-Ahead Forecast

The one-step-ahead forecast at time $h$ is given by:

$$

\hat{r}_h(1) = E(r_{h+1} | F_h) = \phi_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i r_{h+1-i}
$$

where $F_h$ denotes information available at time $h$.

#### Multi-Step-Ahead Forecasts

For multi-step-ahead forecasts ($\ell > 1$), we use:

$$

\hat{r}_h(\ell) = E(r_{h+\ell} | F_h)
$$

which can be computed recursively using previous forecasts.

**Forecast Error:**

The variance of forecast errors increases with forecast horizon $\ell$, reflecting increased uncertainty.

### Example: U.S. Quarterly Real GNP Growth Rate

Consider fitting an AR(3) model to U.S. quarterly real GNP growth rates:

$$

r_t = 0.0047 + 0.348 r_{t-1} + 0.179 r_{t-2} - 0.142 r_{t-3} + a_t
$$

The characteristic equation has complex roots, indicating cyclical behavior with an average cycle length of approximately three years.

This section provides foundational knowledge on simple AR models, essential for understanding more complex time series models used in financial econometrics.
