## Simple MA Models

Moving-average (MA) models are another class of simple models useful for modeling financial return series. These models capture the linear dependencies between a variable and its past forecast errors. This section explores the properties, identification, estimation, and forecasting of simple MA models.

### Properties of MA Models

#### MA(1) Model

A moving-average model of order 1, denoted as MA(1), is defined as:

$$
r_t = c_0 + a_t - \theta_1 a_{t-1}
$$

where $\{a_t\}$ is a white noise series with mean zero and variance $\sigma_a^2$, and $c_0$ is a constant.

**Stationarity:**

MA models are always weakly stationary because they are finite linear combinations of a white noise sequence.

**Mean and Variance:**

For an MA(1) model, the mean and variance are given by:

$$
E(r_t) = c_0
$$

$$
Var(r_t) = (1 + \theta_1^2) \sigma_a^2
$$

**Autocorrelation Function (ACF):**

For an MA(1) model, the autocorrelation function is:

$$
\rho_0 = 1, \quad \rho_1 = \frac{-\theta_1}{1 + \theta_1^2}, \quad \rho_\ell = 0 \text{ for } \ell > 1
$$

This implies that the ACF of an MA(1) model cuts off after lag 1.

#### MA(2) Model

A moving-average model of order 2, denoted as MA(2), is defined as:

$$
r_t = c_0 + a_t - \theta_1 a_{t-1} - \theta_2 a_{t-2}
$$

**Autocorrelation Function (ACF):**

For an MA(2) model, the autocorrelation function is:

$$
\rho_0 = 1, \quad \rho_1 = \frac{-\theta_1 + \theta_1\theta_2}{1 + \theta_1^2 + \theta_2^2}, \quad \rho_2 = \frac{-\theta_2}{1 + \theta_1^2 + \theta_2^2}, \quad \rho_\ell = 0 \text{ for } \ell > 2
$$

This implies that the ACF of an MA(2) model cuts off after lag 2.

### Identifying MA Order

The ACF is useful for identifying the order of an MA model. For a time series $r_t$ with ACF $\rho_\ell$, if $\rho_q \neq 0$ but $\rho_\ell = 0$ for $\ell > q$, then $r_t$ follows an MA($q$) model.

#### Example: CRSP Equal-Weighted Index

Consider the monthly simple returns of the CRSP equal-weighted index from January 1926 to December 2008. The sample ACF shows significant values at lags 1, 3, and 9, suggesting an MA(9) model:

$$
r_t = c_0 + a_t - \theta_1 a_{t-1} - \theta_3 a_{t-3} - \theta_9 a_{t-9}
$$

### Estimation

Maximum-likelihood estimation is commonly used to estimate MA models. There are two approaches for evaluating the likelihood function:

- **Conditional-Likelihood Method:** Assumes initial shocks $a_t$ for $t \leq 0$ are zero.
- **Exact-Likelihood Method:** Treats initial shocks as additional parameters.

The exact method is preferred when the MA model is close to being noninvertible but requires more computation.

#### Example: CRSP Equal-Weighted Index

For the identified MA(9) model, conditional maximum-likelihood estimation yields:

$$
r_t = 0.012 + a_t + 0.189a_{t-1} - 0.121a_{t-3} + 0.122a_{t-9}, \quad \hat{\sigma}_a = 0.0714
$$

The exact maximum-likelihood method produces similar estimates.

### Forecasting Using MA Models

Forecasting with MA models involves predicting future values based on past observations and errors.

#### One-Step-Ahead Forecast

For an MA(1) process at forecast origin $h$:

$$
\hat{r}_h(1) = E(r_{h+1} | F_h) = c_0 - \theta_1 a_h
$$

The forecast error variance is:

$$
Var(e_h(1)) = \sigma_a^2
$$

#### Multi-Step-Ahead Forecasts

For an MA($q$) model, multi-step-ahead forecasts converge to the mean after $q$ steps:

$$
\hat{r}_h(\ell) = c_0, \quad \text{for } \ell > q
$$

The variance of forecast errors also converges to the variance of the series after $q$ steps.

#### Example: CRSP Equal-Weighted Index

Out-of-sample forecasts for an MA(9) model at forecast origin $h=986$ (February 2008) show that forecasts quickly converge to the sample mean.

### Summary

Key properties of AR and MA models include:

- **MA Models:** ACF cuts off at lag $q$, always stationary.
- **AR Models:** PACF cuts off at lag $p$, stationarity requires characteristic roots less than one in modulus.

This section provides foundational knowledge on simple MA models, essential for understanding more complex time series models used in financial econometrics.
