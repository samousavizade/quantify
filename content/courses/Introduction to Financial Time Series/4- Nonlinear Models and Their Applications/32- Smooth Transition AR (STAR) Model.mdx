## Smooth Transition AR (STAR) Model

The smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) model is a nonlinear time series model that allows for smooth transitions between different regimes. It can be seen as a generalization of the threshold autoregressive (TAR) model, where the transition between regimes is abrupt. The STAR model was introduced by Chan and Tong (1986) and further developed by Ter√§svirta (1994).

### Model Specification

A general STAR model of order $p$ can be written as:

$$
r_t = \left(\phi_{0,1} + \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_{i,1} r_{t-i}\right)(1 - G(s_t; \gamma, c)) + \left(\phi_{0,2} + \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_{i,2} r_{t-i}\right)G(s_t; \gamma, c) + \epsilon_t
$$

where:

- $r_t$ is the time series of interest
- $\phi_{0,j}$ and $\phi_{i,j}$ ($j = 1, 2$) are the autoregressive parameters for the two regimes
- $G(s_t; \gamma, c)$ is the transition function, bounded between 0 and 1
- $s_t$ is the transition variable
- $\gamma$ is the smoothness parameter
- $c$ is the threshold parameter
- $\epsilon_t$ is a white noise process with zero mean and constant variance $\sigma^2$

The transition function $G(s_t; \gamma, c)$ determines the degree of membership in each regime. As $G(s_t; \gamma, c)$ approaches 1, the model behaves more like the second regime, and as it approaches 0, the model behaves more like the first regime.

### Transition Functions

Two common choices for the transition function are:

1. Logistic STAR (LSTAR) model:

$$
G(s_t; \gamma, c) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\gamma(s_t - c))}
$$

2. Exponential STAR (ESTAR) model:

$$
G(s_t; \gamma, c) = 1 - \exp(-\gamma(s_t - c)^2)
$$

The logistic function allows for asymmetric behavior in the two regimes, while the exponential function implies symmetric behavior.

### Properties of STAR Models

1. **Smooth Transition**: Unlike TAR models, STAR models allow for a smooth transition between regimes, which can be more realistic in many applications.

2. **Nesting Linear Models**: When $\gamma \to 0$, the STAR model reduces to a linear AR model. When $\gamma \to \infty$, the LSTAR model becomes a TAR model.

3. **Flexibility**: STAR models can capture a wide range of nonlinear dynamics, including asymmetric cycles and multiple equilibria.

4. **Interpretability**: The parameters have clear interpretations in terms of the behavior in different regimes.

### Estimation

Estimation of STAR models is typically done using nonlinear least squares or maximum likelihood methods. The procedure often involves the following steps:

1. Specify the linear AR model as a starting point.
2. Test for linearity against STAR nonlinearity.
3. Choose between LSTAR and ESTAR models.
4. Estimate the parameters of the chosen STAR model.
5. Evaluate the model using diagnostic tests.

The likelihood function for a STAR model, assuming Gaussian errors, is given by:

$$
L(\theta) = \prod_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(r_t - \mu_t(\theta))^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

where $\theta$ represents all the parameters of the model, and $\mu_t(\theta)$ is the conditional mean of $r_t$ given by the STAR model.

### Linearity Testing

Before estimating a STAR model, it's important to test for the presence of nonlinearity. A common approach is to use a Taylor series expansion of the transition function around $\gamma = 0$. This leads to an auxiliary regression of the form:

$$
r_t = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i r_{t-i} + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_{i+p} r_{t-i} s_t + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_{i+2p} r_{t-i} s_t^2 + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_{i+3p} r_{t-i} s_t^3 + \epsilon_t
$$

The null hypothesis of linearity corresponds to $\beta_{i+p} = \beta_{i+2p} = \beta_{i+3p} = 0$ for all $i$. This can be tested using an F-test or LM-test.

### Model Selection

Choosing between LSTAR and ESTAR models can be based on the auxiliary regression above. If only the second-order terms are significant, an ESTAR model is suggested. If the first- or third-order terms are significant, an LSTAR model is more appropriate.

### Forecasting

Forecasting with STAR models is more complex than with linear models due to the nonlinearity. One-step-ahead forecasts can be computed as:

$$
\hat{r}_{T+1|T} = E[r_{T+1}|F_T] = \left(\phi_{0,1} + \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_{i,1} r_{T+1-i}\right)(1 - E[G(s_{T+1}; \gamma, c)|F_T]) + \left(\phi_{0,2} + \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_{i,2} r_{T+1-i}\right)E[G(s_{T+1}; \gamma, c)|F_T]
$$

where $F_T$ represents the information available at time $T$. For multi-step forecasts, simulation methods are often used due to the nonlinearity of the model.

### Applications in Finance

STAR models have found various applications in finance, including:

1. **Exchange Rate Modeling**: Capturing nonlinear dynamics in exchange rate movements, particularly the different behavior near and far from equilibrium levels.

2. **Stock Return Prediction**: Modeling regime-switching behavior in stock returns, where market dynamics may differ in bull and bear markets.

3. **Interest Rate Modeling**: Describing the nonlinear adjustment of interest rates, which may exhibit different behavior for small and large deviations from equilibrium.

4. **Volatility Forecasting**: Extending STAR models to capture smooth transitions in volatility regimes.

### Example: STAR Model for Stock Returns

Consider a LSTAR(2) model for monthly stock returns:

$$
r_t = (0.02 + 0.3r_{t-1} - 0.1r_{t-2})(1 - G(r_{t-1}; 5, 0)) + (-0.01 + 0.1r_{t-1} + 0.2r_{t-2})G(r_{t-1}; 5, 0) + \epsilon_t
$$

$$
G(r_{t-1}; 5, 0) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-5r_{t-1})}
$$

This model suggests two regimes:

1. When $r_{t-1}$ is negative (bear market), the process behaves more like the first AR(2) model with higher persistence.
2. When $r_{t-1}$ is positive (bull market), the process transitions towards the second AR(2) model with lower persistence and a negative intercept.

The smooth transition allows for a gradual change between these regimes, capturing the idea that market dynamics don't change abruptly but rather evolve over time.

In conclusion, STAR models provide a flexible framework for modeling nonlinear dynamics in financial time series, allowing for smooth transitions between different regimes. Their ability to nest both linear AR models and threshold models makes them a versatile tool for capturing complex patterns in financial data.
