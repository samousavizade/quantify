## Stochastic Volatility Model

Stochastic volatility (SV) models provide an alternative approach to modeling time-varying volatility. Unlike GARCH-type models where the conditional variance is a deterministic function of past observations, SV models treat volatility as an unobserved component following some latent stochastic process. The basic SV model can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
r_t &= \sigma_t \epsilon_t \\
\ln(\sigma_t^2) &= \alpha + \beta \ln(\sigma_{t-1}^2) + \eta_t
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\{\epsilon_t\}$ and $\{\eta_t\}$ are two independent Gaussian white noise series with mean zero and variances 1 and $\sigma_\eta^2$, respectively. The log-volatility $\ln(\sigma_t^2)$ is modeled as an AR(1) process.

The SV model has several appealing features:

1. It allows for a separate noise term $\eta_t$ in the volatility equation, providing more flexibility in modeling volatility dynamics.

2. The log-volatility specification ensures that $\sigma_t^2$ is always positive.

3. It has a natural interpretation in terms of Clark's (1973) mixture of distributions hypothesis, where volatility is related to the rate of information flow in financial markets.

However, estimation of SV models is more challenging than GARCH models due to the presence of the latent volatility process. The likelihood function does not have a closed-form expression, making maximum likelihood estimation difficult. Various methods have been proposed to estimate SV models, including:

1. Quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) based on a linear state-space representation.
2. Generalized method of moments (GMM).
3. Efficient method of moments (EMM).
4. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.
5. Particle filtering and smoothing methods.

Among these, MCMC methods have gained popularity due to their flexibility and ability to provide full posterior distributions of model parameters and latent volatilities. We will discuss MCMC estimation of SV models in more detail in Chapter 12.

### Properties of the SV Model

To understand the properties of the SV model, we can examine its moments and autocorrelation structure. Let $h_t = \ln(\sigma_t^2)$ denote the log-volatility. Then:

$$
h_t = \alpha + \beta h_{t-1} + \eta_t
$$

For stationarity, we require $|\beta| < 1$. Under this condition, the unconditional mean and variance of $h_t$ are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[h_t] &= \frac{\alpha}{1-\beta} \\
\text{Var}(h_t) &= \frac{\sigma_\eta^2}{1-\beta^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The autocorrelation function of $h_t$ is given by:

$$
\text{Corr}(h_t, h_{t-k}) = \beta^k
$$

For the returns $r_t$, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[r_t] &= 0 \\
\text{Var}(r_t) &= E[\sigma_t^2] = \exp\left(E[h_t] + \frac{1}{2}\text{Var}(h_t)\right) = \exp\left(\frac{\alpha}{1-\beta} + \frac{\sigma_\eta^2}{2(1-\beta^2)}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

The kurtosis of $r_t$ is:

$$
\text{Kurt}(r_t) = 3\exp\left(\frac{\sigma_\eta^2}{1-\beta^2}\right)
$$

which is always greater than 3, indicating that the SV model captures the heavy-tailed nature of financial returns.

The autocorrelation function of $r_t$ is zero at all lags, but the squared returns $r_t^2$ exhibit autocorrelation. The theoretical ACF of $r_t^2$ is:

$$
\text{Corr}(r_t^2, r_{t-k}^2) = \frac{\exp(\beta^k \sigma_\eta^2 / (1-\beta^2)) - 1}{\exp(\sigma_\eta^2 / (1-\beta^2)) - 1}
$$

This ACF decays more slowly than the exponential decay of a GARCH(1,1) model, potentially capturing long-memory features in volatility.

### Comparison with GARCH Models

While both SV and GARCH models aim to capture time-varying volatility, they have some key differences:

1. **Volatility specification**: In GARCH models, volatility is a deterministic function of past returns and volatilities. In SV models, volatility is a latent stochastic process.

2. **Flexibility**: SV models generally offer more flexibility in capturing volatility dynamics due to the separate noise term in the volatility equation.

3. **Persistence**: SV models can generate more persistent volatility processes, which may be more suitable for some financial time series.

4. **Estimation**: GARCH models are typically easier to estimate using maximum likelihood, while SV models often require more complex estimation techniques.

5. **Forecasting**: GARCH models provide straightforward volatility forecasts, while forecasting with SV models usually involves simulation-based methods.

### Extensions of the Basic SV Model

Several extensions of the basic SV model have been proposed to capture additional features of financial time series:

1. **Leverage effect**: To model asymmetric volatility response to positive and negative returns, a correlation between $\epsilon_t$ and $\eta_{t+1}$ can be introduced.

2. **Heavy-tailed distributions**: The Gaussian assumption for $\epsilon_t$ can be replaced with heavier-tailed distributions like Student's t or generalized error distribution.

3. **Long memory**: The AR(1) process for log-volatility can be replaced with a fractionally integrated process to capture long-range dependence in volatility.

4. **Jump components**: Jumps in returns or volatility can be incorporated to model sudden, large movements in asset prices.

5. **Multivariate extensions**: SV models can be extended to multiple assets, allowing for time-varying correlations and volatility spillovers.

### Conclusion

Stochastic volatility models provide a flexible framework for modeling time-varying volatility in financial time series. While their estimation is more challenging than GARCH-type models, they offer potential advantages in terms of capturing complex volatility dynamics and accommodating various stylized facts of financial returns. The choice between GARCH and SV models often depends on the specific application, the characteristics of the data, and the trade-off between model complexity and estimation simplicity.
