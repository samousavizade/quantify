## The Threshold GARCH Model

The threshold GARCH (TGARCH) model is another volatility model that can capture asymmetric effects in asset returns. It was proposed independently by Zakoian (1994) and Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (1993). The latter authors referred to the model as the GJR model. The TGARCH model differs from the EGARCH model in that it uses different coefficients to capture the asymmetric effects of positive and negative shocks on volatility.

### Model Specification

The TGARCH(m,s) model is defined as:

$$

\sigma_t^2 = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^m (\alpha_i + \gamma_i N_{t-i}) a_{t-i}^2 + \sum_{j=1}^s \beta_j \sigma_{t-j}^2
$$

where $N_{t-i}$ is an indicator function defined as:

$$

N_{t-i} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } a_{t-i} < 0 \\
0 & \text{if } a_{t-i} \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$

In this model:

- $\alpha_0 > 0$
- $\alpha_i \geq 0$ for $i = 1, ..., m$
- $\beta_j \geq 0$ for $j = 1, ..., s$
- $\alpha_i + \gamma_i \geq 0$ for $i = 1, ..., m$

These constraints ensure that the conditional variance $\sigma_t^2$ is always positive.

### Interpretation

The TGARCH model allows for different impacts of positive and negative shocks on volatility:

1. When $a_{t-i} \geq 0$ (positive shock), the contribution to $\sigma_t^2$ is $\alpha_i a_{t-i}^2$.
2. When $a_{t-i} < 0$ (negative shock), the contribution to $\sigma_t^2$ is $(\alpha_i + \gamma_i) a_{t-i}^2$.

If $\gamma_i > 0$, then negative shocks have a larger impact on volatility than positive shocks of the same magnitude. This captures the leverage effect observed in many financial time series.

### Special Cases

1. When $\gamma_i = 0$ for all $i$, the TGARCH model reduces to the standard GARCH model.
2. The TGARCH(1,1) model, which is commonly used in practice, is given by:

$$

\sigma_t^2 = \alpha_0 + (\alpha_1 + \gamma_1 N_{t-1}) a_{t-1}^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_{t-1}^2
$$

### Properties

1. **Stationarity**: The TGARCH model is covariance stationary if:

$$

\sum_{i=1}^m (\alpha_i + \frac{1}{2}\gamma_i) + \sum_{j=1}^s \beta_j < 1
$$

2. **Unconditional Variance**: For a TGARCH(1,1) model, the unconditional variance is:

$$

E(\sigma_t^2) = \frac{\alpha_0}{1 - (\alpha_1 + \frac{1}{2}\gamma_1) - \beta_1}
$$

3. **Persistence**: The persistence of shocks in a TGARCH(1,1) model is measured by $\alpha_1 + \frac{1}{2}\gamma_1 + \beta_1$.

### Estimation

The TGARCH model can be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Assuming the innovations follow a normal distribution, the log-likelihood function for a sample of T observations is:

$$

L(\theta) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{t=1}^T \left( \log(2\pi) + \log(\sigma_t^2) + \frac{a_t^2}{\sigma_t^2} \right)
$$

where $\theta$ represents the vector of model parameters. The MLE estimates are obtained by maximizing this log-likelihood function with respect to $\theta$.

### Forecasting

For a TGARCH(1,1) model, the one-step-ahead forecast of volatility at time $t$ is:

$$

\sigma_{t+1|t}^2 = \alpha_0 + (\alpha_1 + \gamma_1 N_t) a_t^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_t^2
$$

Multi-step forecasts can be computed recursively, similar to the GARCH model, but taking into account the expected value of the indicator function:

$$

E[N_{t+k}] = P(a_{t+k} < 0) = 0.5
$$

assuming the innovations are symmetrically distributed around zero.

### Comparison with EGARCH

Both TGARCH and EGARCH models can capture asymmetric effects in volatility, but they differ in several aspects:

1. **Functional Form**: TGARCH uses a piecewise linear function of lagged innovations, while EGARCH uses an exponential function.

2. **Constraints**: TGARCH requires parameter constraints to ensure positive variance, while EGARCH does not due to its log-linear form.

3. **Interpretation**: In TGARCH, the asymmetric effect is captured by different coefficients for positive and negative shocks. In EGARCH, it's captured by a single coefficient on the standardized innovation.

4. **Magnitude of Effect**: In TGARCH, the asymmetric effect is proportional to the squared innovation. In EGARCH, it's proportional to the absolute value of the standardized innovation.

### Example Application

Consider modeling the daily returns of a stock index using a TGARCH(1,1) model. After estimation, suppose we obtain the following model:

$$

\sigma_t^2 = 0.00001 + (0.02 + 0.05N_{t-1})a_{t-1}^2 + 0.93\sigma_{t-1}^2
$$

Interpretation:

1. The constant term $\alpha_0 = 0.00001$ represents the baseline volatility.
2. For positive shocks ($a_{t-1} \geq 0$), the impact on volatility is $0.02a_{t-1}^2$.
3. For negative shocks ($a_{t-1} < 0$), the impact is $(0.02 + 0.05)a_{t-1}^2 = 0.07a_{t-1}^2$.
4. The coefficient $\gamma_1 = 0.05 > 0$ indicates the presence of leverage effect: negative shocks have a larger impact on volatility than positive shocks.
5. The persistence of shocks, measured by $\alpha_1 + \frac{1}{2}\gamma_1 + \beta_1 = 0.02 + 0.5(0.05) + 0.93 = 0.975$, is high, indicating that volatility shocks are long-lasting.

This model suggests that the stock index returns exhibit significant asymmetry in volatility response to shocks, with negative returns leading to higher subsequent volatility than positive returns of the same magnitude.

In conclusion, the TGARCH model provides a flexible framework for modeling asymmetric volatility in financial time series. Its ability to differentiate between the impacts of positive and negative shocks makes it particularly useful for analyzing assets that exhibit leverage effects. However, like all models, it should be used in conjunction with careful diagnostic checking and comparison with alternative specifications to ensure its appropriateness for the data at hand.
