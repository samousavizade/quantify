# Overview of The Course

## 1.1 Overview

This lecture series provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of economics, focusing on the application of mathematical and statistical concepts to real-world problems. Through a combination of theoretical explanations, Python code, and interactive visualizations, students will gain a deeper understanding of economic principles and develop practical skills in data analysis and simulation.

## 1.2 Level

This lecture series is primarily targeted at undergraduate students.

The difficulty level varies, ranging from introductory content (appropriate for first-year undergraduates or even high school students) to more intermediate material. The intermediate sections assume familiarity with linear algebra and some mathematical maturity, such as reading and interpreting theorems.

In general, the easier lectures appear earlier in the series, while the more challenging ones come later. We expect that readers will have completed introductory Python programming sections and be comfortable with basic Python syntax, including functions. Familiarity with classes and Matplotlib would be helpful, though not strictly necessary.

## 1.3 About

These lectures aim to engage students interested in learning both economics and computing, as well as students from fields like computer science and engineering who are curious about economics.

The lectures are designed for various contexts, including university courses, self-study, reading groups, and workshops. Researchers and policy professionals may also find parts of the series beneficial for their work.

We stress the critical importance of economic theory and the value of analyzing data and understanding stylized facts.

While the presentation offers a fresh approach, the ideas discussed are quite foundational.
