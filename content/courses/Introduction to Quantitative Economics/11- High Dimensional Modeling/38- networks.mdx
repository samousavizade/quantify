## Outline

In recent years there has been rapid growth in a field
called [network science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science).

Network science studies relationships between groups of objects.

One important example is the [world wide web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web#Linking)
, where web pages are connected by hyperlinks.

Another is the [human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_circuit): studies of brain function emphasize the
network of
connections between nerve cells (neurons).

[Artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) are based on this idea, using data
to build
intricate connections between simple processing units.

Epidemiologists studying [transmission of diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_medicine#Network_epidemics)
like COVID-19 analyze interactions between groups of human hosts.

In operations research, network analysis is used to study fundamental problems
as on minimum cost flow, the traveling salesman, [shortest paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem),
and assignment.

This lecture gives an introduction to economic and financial networks.

## Economic and financial networks

Within economics, important examples of networks include

- financial networks
- production networks
- trade networks
- transport networks and
- social networks

Social networks affect trends in market sentiment and consumer decisions.

The structure of financial networks helps to determine relative fragility of the financial system.

The structure of production networks affects trade, innovation and the propagation of local shocks.

To better understand such networks, let’s look at some examples in more depth.

### Example: Aircraft Exports

The following figure shows international trade in large commercial aircraft in 2019 based on International Trade Data
SITC Revision 2.

```python
ch1_data = qbn_data.introduction()
export_figures = False

DG = ch1_data['aircraft_network']
pos = ch1_data['aircraft_network_pos']

centrality = nx.eigenvector_centrality(DG)
node_total_exports = qbn_io.node_total_exports(DG)
edge_weights = qbn_io.edge_weights(DG)

node_pos_dict = pos

node_sizes = qbn_io.normalise_weights(node_total_exports,10000)
edge_widths = qbn_io.normalise_weights(edge_weights,10)

node_colors = qbn_io.colorise_weights(list(centrality.values()),color_palette=cm.viridis)
node_to_color = dict(zip(DG.nodes,node_colors))
edge_colors = []
for src,_ in DG.edges:
    edge_colors.append(node_to_color[src])

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
ax.axis('off')

nx.draw_networkx_nodes(DG,
                       node_pos_dict,
                       node_color=node_colors,
                       node_size=node_sizes,
                       linewidths=2,
                       alpha=0.6,
                       ax=ax)

nx.draw_networkx_labels(DG,
                        node_pos_dict,
                        ax=ax)

nx.draw_networkx_edges(DG,
                       node_pos_dict,
                       edge_color=edge_colors,
                       width=edge_widths,
                       arrows=True,
                       arrowsize=20,
                       ax=ax,
                       arrowstyle='->',
                       node_size=node_sizes,
                       connectionstyle='arc3,rad=0.15')

plt.show()
```

The circles in the figure are called **nodes** or **vertices** – in this case they represent countries.

The arrows in the figure are called **edges** or **links**.

Node size is proportional to total exports and edge width is proportional to exports to the target country.

(The data is for trade in commercial aircraft weighing at least 15,000kg and was sourced from CID Dataverse.)

The figure shows that the US, France and Germany are major export hubs.

In the discussion below, we learn to quantify such ideas.

### Example: A Markov Chain

Recall that, in our lecture on Markov Chains we studied a
dynamic model of business cycles
where the states are

- “ng” = “normal growth”
- “mr” = “mild recession”
- “sr” = “severe recession”

Let’s examine the following figure

![png](https://intro.quantecon.org/_static/lecture_specific/networks/mc.png)

This is an example of a network, where the set of nodes $ V $ equals the states:

$$
V = \{ \text{"ng", "mr", "sr"} \}
$$

The edges between the nodes show the one month transition probabilities.

## An introduction to graph theory

Now we’ve looked at some examples, let’s move on to theory.

This theory will allow us to better organize our thoughts.

The theoretical part of network science is constructed using a major branch of
mathematics called [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).

Graph theory can be complicated and we will cover only the basics.

However, these concepts will already be enough for us to discuss interesting and
important ideas on economic and financial networks.

We focus on “directed” graphs, where connections are, in general, asymmetric
(arrows typically point one way, not both ways).

E.g.,

- bank $ A $ lends money to bank $ B $
- firm $ A $ supplies goods to firm $ B $
- individual $ A $ “follows” individual $ B $ on a given social network

(“Undirected” graphs, where connections are symmetric, are a special
case of directed graphs — we just need to insist that each arrow pointing
from $ A $ to $ B $ is paired with another arrow pointing from $ B $ to $ A $.)

### Key definitions

A **directed graph** consists of two things:

1. a finite set $ V $ and
1. a collection of pairs $ (u, v) $ where $ u $ and $ v $ are elements of $ V $.

The elements of $ V $ are called the **vertices** or **nodes** of the graph.

The pairs $ (u,v) $ are called the **edges** of the graph and the set of all edges will usually be denoted by $ E $

Intuitively and visually, an edge $ (u,v) $ is understood as an arrow from node $ u $ to node $ v $.

(A neat way to represent an arrow is to record the location of the tail and
head of the arrow, and that’s exactly what an edge does.)

In the aircraft export example shown in Fig. 41.1

- $ V $ is all countries included in the data set.
- $ E $ is all the arrows in the figure, each indicating some positive amount of aircraft exports from one country to
  another.

Let’s look at more examples.

Two graphs are shown below, each with three nodes.

![png](https://intro.quantecon.org/_static/lecture_specific/networks/poverty_trap_1.png)

Poverty Trap  
We now construct a graph with the same nodes but different edges.

![png](https://intro.quantecon.org/_static/lecture_specific/networks/poverty_trap_2.png)

Poverty Trap  
For these graphs, the arrows (edges) can be thought of as representing
positive transition probabilities over a given unit of time.

In general, if an edge $ (u, v) $ exists, then the node $ u $ is called a
**direct predecessor** of $ v $ and $ v $ is called a **direct successor** of $ u $.

Also, for $ v \in V $,

- the **in-degree** is $ i_d(v) = $ the number of direct predecessors of $ v $ and
- the **out-degree** is $ o_d(v) = $ the number of direct successors of $ v $.

### Digraphs in Networkx

The Python package [Networkx](https://networkx.org/) provides a convenient
data structure for representing directed graphs and implements many common
routines for analyzing them.

As an example, let us recreate Fig. 41.3 using Networkx.

To do so, we first create an empty `DiGraph` object:

```python
G_p = nx.DiGraph()
```

Next we populate it with nodes and edges.

To do this we write down a list of
all edges, with _poor_ represented by _p_ and so on:

```python
edge_list = [('p', 'p'),
             ('m', 'p'), ('m', 'm'), ('m', 'r'),
             ('r', 'p'), ('r', 'm'), ('r', 'r')]
```

Finally, we add the edges to our `DiGraph` object:

```python
for e in edge_list:
    u, v = e
    G_p.add_edge(u, v)
```

Alternatively, we can use the method `add_edges_from`.

```python
G_p.add_edges_from(edge_list)
```

Adding the edges automatically adds the nodes, so `G_p` is now a
correct representation of our graph.

We can verify this by plotting the graph via Networkx with the following code:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
nx.draw_spring(G_p, ax=ax, node_size=500, with_labels=True,
               font_weight='bold', arrows=True, alpha=0.8,
               connectionstyle='arc3,rad=0.25', arrowsize=20)
plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/networks_files/networks_20_0.png)

The figure obtained above matches the original directed graph in Fig. 41.3.

`DiGraph` objects have methods that calculate in-degree and out-degree
of nodes.

For example,

```python
G_p.in_degree('p')
```

    3

### Communication

Next, we study communication and connectedness, which have important
implications for economic networks.

Node $ v $ is called **accessible** from node $ u $ if either $ u=v $ or there
exists a sequence of edges that lead from $ u $ to $ v $.

- in this case, we write $ u \to v $

(Visually, there is a sequence of arrows leading from $ u $ to $ v $.)

For example, suppose we have a directed graph representing a production network, where

- elements of $ V $ are industrial sectors and
- existence of an edge $ (i, j) $ means that $ i $ supplies products or services to $ j $.

Then $ m \to \ell $ means that sector $ m $ is an upstream supplier of sector $ \ell $.

Two nodes $ u $ and $ v $ are said to **communicate** if both $ u \to v $ and $ v \to u $.

A graph is called **strongly connected** if all nodes communicate.

For example, Fig. 41.2 is strongly connected
however in Fig. 41.3 rich is not accessible from poor, thus it is not strongly connected.

We can verify this by first constructing the graphs using Networkx and then using `nx.is_strongly_connected`.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
G1 = nx.DiGraph()

G1.add_edges_from([('p', 'p'),('p','m'),('p','r'),
             ('m', 'p'), ('m', 'm'), ('m', 'r'),
             ('r', 'p'), ('r', 'm'), ('r', 'r')])

nx.draw_networkx(G1, with_labels = True)
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/networks_files/networks_25_0.png)

```python
nx.is_strongly_connected(G1)    #checking if above graph is strongly connected
```

    True

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
G2 = nx.DiGraph()

G2.add_edges_from([('p', 'p'),
             ('m', 'p'), ('m', 'm'), ('m', 'r'),
             ('r', 'p'), ('r', 'm'), ('r', 'r')])

nx.draw_networkx(G2, with_labels = True)
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/networks_files/networks_27_0.png)

```python
nx.is_strongly_connected(G2)    #checking if above graph is strongly connected
```

    False

## Weighted graphs

We now introduce weighted graphs, where weights (numbers) are attached to each
edge.

### International private credit flows by country

To motivate the idea, consider the following figure which shows flows of funds (i.e.,
loans) between private banks, grouped by country of origin.

```python
Z = ch1_data["adjacency_matrix"]["Z"]
Z_visual= ch1_data["adjacency_matrix"]["Z_visual"]
countries = ch1_data["adjacency_matrix"]["countries"]

G = qbn_io.adjacency_matrix_to_graph(Z_visual, countries, tol=0.03)

centrality = qbn_io.eigenvector_centrality(Z_visual, authority=False)
node_total_exports = qbn_io.node_total_exports(G)
edge_weights = qbn_io.edge_weights(G)

node_pos_dict = nx.circular_layout(G)

node_sizes = qbn_io.normalise_weights(node_total_exports,3000)
edge_widths = qbn_io.normalise_weights(edge_weights,10)


node_colors = qbn_io.colorise_weights(centrality)
node_to_color = dict(zip(G.nodes,node_colors))
edge_colors = []
for src,_ in G.edges:
    edge_colors.append(node_to_color[src])

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
ax.axis('off')

nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G,
                       node_pos_dict,
                       node_color=node_colors,
                       node_size=node_sizes,
                       edgecolors='grey',
                       linewidths=2,
                       alpha=0.4,
                       ax=ax)

nx.draw_networkx_labels(G,
                        node_pos_dict,
                        font_size=12,
                        ax=ax)

nx.draw_networkx_edges(G,
                       node_pos_dict,
                       edge_color=edge_colors,
                       width=edge_widths,
                       arrows=True,
                       arrowsize=20,
                       alpha=0.8,
                       ax=ax,
                       arrowstyle='->',
                       node_size=node_sizes,
                       connectionstyle='arc3,rad=0.15')

plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/networks_files/networks_31_0.png)

The country codes are given in the following table

| Code |    Country    | Code | Country | Code |   Country   | Code |    Country     |
| :--: | :-----------: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :---------: | :--: | :------------: |
|  AU  |   Australia   |  DE  | Germany |  CL  |    Chile    |  ES  |     Spain      |
|  PT  |   Portugal    |  FR  | France  |  TR  |   Turkey    |  GB  | United Kingdom |
|  US  | United States |  IE  | Ireland |  AT  |   Austria   |  IT  |     Italy      |
|  BE  |    Belgium    |  JP  |  Japan  |  SW  | Switzerland |  SE  |     Sweden     |

An arrow from Japan to the US indicates aggregate claims held by Japanese
banks on all US-registered banks, as collected by the Bank of International
Settlements (BIS).

The size of each node in the figure is increasing in the
total foreign claims of all other nodes on this node.

The widths of the arrows are proportional to the foreign claims they represent.

Notice that, in this network, an edge $ (u, v) $ exists for almost every choice
of $ u $ and $ v $ (i.e., almost every country in the network).

(In fact, there are even more small arrows, which we have dropped for clarity.)

Hence the existence of an edge from one node to another is not particularly informative.

To understand the network, we need to record not just the existence or absence
of a credit flow, but also the size of the flow.

The correct data structure for recording this information is a “weighted
directed graph”.

### Definitions

A **weighted directed graph** is a directed graph to which we have added a
**weight function** $ w $ that assigns a positive number to each edge.

The figure above shows one weighted directed graph, where the weights are the size of fund flows.

The following figure shows a weighted directed graph, with arrows
representing edges of the induced directed graph.

![png](https://intro.quantecon.org/_static/lecture_specific/networks/weighted.png)

Weighted Poverty Trap  
The numbers next to the edges are the weights.

In this case, you can think of the numbers on the arrows as transition
probabilities for a household over, say, one year.

We see that a rich household has a 10% chance of becoming poor in one year.

## Adjacency matrices

Another way that we can represent weights, which turns out to be very
convenient for numerical work, is via a matrix.

The **adjacency matrix** of a weighted directed graph with nodes $ \{v_1, \ldots, v_n\} $, edges $ E $ and weight
function $ w $ is the matrix

$$
A = (a_{ij})_{1 \leq i,j \leq n}
\quad \text{with} \quad
a_{ij} =
%
\begin{cases}
w(v_i, v_j) & \text{ if } (v_i, v_j) \in E
\\
0 & \text{ otherwise}.
\end{cases}
%
$$

Once the nodes in $ V $ are enumerated, the weight function and
adjacency matrix provide essentially the same information.

For example, with $ \{ $poor, middle, rich$ \} $ mapped to $ \{1, 2, 3\} $ respectively,
the adjacency matrix corresponding to the weighted directed graph in Fig. 41.5 is

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0.9 & 0.1 & 0 \\
0.4 & 0.4 & 0.2 \\
0.1 & 0.1 & 0.8
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

In QuantEcon’s `DiGraph` implementation, weights are recorded via the
keyword `weighted`:

```python
A = ((0.9, 0.1, 0.0),
     (0.4, 0.4, 0.2),
     (0.1, 0.1, 0.8))
A = np.array(A)
G = qe.DiGraph(A, weighted=True)    # store weights
```

One of the key points to remember about adjacency matrices is that taking the
transpose _reverses all the arrows_ in the associated directed graph.

For example, the following directed graph can be
interpreted as a stylized version of a financial network, with nodes as banks
and edges showing the flow of funds.

```python
G4 = nx.DiGraph()

G4.add_edges_from([('1','2'),
                   ('2','1'),('2','3'),
                   ('3','4'),
                   ('4','2'),('4','5'),
                   ('5','1'),('5','3'),('5','4')])
pos = nx.circular_layout(G4)

edge_labels={('1','2'): '100',
             ('2','1'): '50', ('2','3'): '200',
             ('3','4'): '100',
             ('4','2'): '500', ('4','5'): '50',
             ('5','1'): '150',('5','3'): '250', ('5','4'): '300'}

nx.draw_networkx(G4, pos, node_color = 'none',node_size = 500)
nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G4, pos, edge_labels=edge_labels)
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G4, pos, linewidths= 0.5, edgecolors = 'black',
                       node_color = 'none',node_size = 500)

plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/networks_files/networks_37_0.png)

We see that bank 2 extends a loan of size 200 to bank 3.

The corresponding adjacency matrix is

$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 100 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
50 & 0 & 200 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 100 & 0 \\
0 & 500 & 0 & 0 & 50 \\
150 & 0 & 250 & 300 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

The transpose is

$$
A^\top =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 50 & 0 & 0 & 150 \\
100 & 0 & 0 & 500 & 0 \\
0 & 200 & 0 & 0 & 250 \\
0 & 0 & 100 & 0 & 300 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 50 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

The corresponding network is visualized in the following figure which shows the network of liabilities after the loans
have been granted.

Both of these networks (original and transpose) are useful for analyzing financial markets.

```python
G5 = nx.DiGraph()

G5.add_edges_from([('1','2'),('1','5'),
                   ('2','1'),('2','4'),
                   ('3','2'),('3','5'),
                   ('4','3'),('4','5'),
                   ('5','4')])

edge_labels={('1','2'): '50', ('1','5'): '150',
             ('2','1'): '100', ('2','4'): '500',
             ('3','2'): '200', ('3','5'): '250',
             ('4','3'): '100', ('4','5'): '300',
             ('5','4'): '50'}

nx.draw_networkx(G5, pos, node_color = 'none',node_size = 500)
nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G5, pos, edge_labels=edge_labels)
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G5, pos, linewidths= 0.5, edgecolors = 'black',
                       node_color = 'none',node_size = 500)

plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/networks_files/networks_39_0.png)

In general, every nonnegative $ n \times n $ matrix $ A = (a\_{ij}) $ can be
viewed as the adjacency matrix of a weighted directed graph.

To build the graph we set $ V = 1, \ldots, n $ and take the edge set $ E $ to be
all $ (i,j) $ such that $ a\_{ij} > 0 $.

For the weight function we set $ w(i, j) = a\_{ij} $ for all edges $ (i,j) $.

We call this graph the weighted directed graph induced by $ A $.

## Properties

Consider a weighted directed graph with adjacency matrix $ A $.

Let $ a^k\_{ij} $ be element $ i,j $ of $ A^k $, the $ k $-th power of $ A $.

The following result is useful in many applications:

##

For distinct nodes $ i, j $ in $ V $ and any integer $ k $, we have

$$
a^k_{i j} > 0
\quad \text{if and only if} \quad
\text{ \$j\$ is accessible from \$i\$}.
$$

The above result is obvious when $ k=1 $ and a proof of the general case can be
found in [[Sargent and Stachurski, 2022](/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/References#id284)].

Now recall from the eigenvalues lecture that a
non-negative matrix $ A $ is called **irreducible** if for each $ (
i,j) $ there is an integer $ k \geq 0 $ such that $ a^{k}\_{ij} > 0 $.

From the preceding theorem, it is not too difficult (see
[[Sargent and Stachurski, 2022](/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/References#id284)] for details) to get the next
result.

##

For a weighted directed graph the following statements are equivalent:

1. The directed graph is strongly connected.
1. The adjacency matrix of the graph is irreducible.

We illustrate the above theorem with a simple example.

Consider the following weighted directed graph.

![png](https://intro.quantecon.org/_static/lecture_specific/networks/properties.png)

We first create the above network as a Networkx `DiGraph` object.

```python
G6 = nx.DiGraph()

G6.add_edges_from([('1','2'),('1','3'),
                   ('2','1'),
                   ('3','1'),('3','2')])
```

Then we construct the associated adjacency matrix A.

```python
A = np.array([[0,0.7,0.3],    # adjacency matrix A
              [1,0,0],
              [0.4,0.6,0]])
```

```python
def is_irreducible(P):
    n = len(P)
    result = np.zeros((n, n))
    for i in range(n):
        result += np.linalg.matrix_power(P, i)
    return np.all(result > 0)
```

```python
is_irreducible(A)      # check irreducibility of A
```

    True

## Network centrality

When studying networks of all varieties, a recurring topic is the relative
“centrality” or “importance” of different nodes.

Examples include

- ranking of web pages by search engines
- determining the most important bank in a financial network (which one a
  central bank should rescue if there is a financial crisis)
- determining the most important industrial sector in an economy.

In what follows, a **centrality measure** associates to each weighted directed
graph a vector $ m $ where the $ m_i $ is interpreted as the centrality (or rank)
of node $ v_i $.

### Degree centrality

Two elementary measures of “importance” of a node in a given directed
graph are its in-degree and out-degree.

Both of these provide a centrality measure.

In-degree centrality is a vector containing the in-degree of each node in
the graph.

Consider the following simple example.

```python
G7 = nx.DiGraph()

G7.add_nodes_from(['1','2','3','4','5','6','7'])

G7.add_edges_from([('1','2'),('1','6'),
                   ('2','1'),('2','4'),
                   ('3','2'),
                   ('4','2'),
                   ('5','3'),('5','4'),
                   ('6','1'),
                   ('7','4'),('7','6')])
pos = nx.planar_layout(G7)

nx.draw_networkx(G7, pos, node_color='none', node_size=500)
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G7, pos, linewidths=0.5, edgecolors='black',
                       node_color='none',node_size=500)

plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/networks_files/networks_52_0.png)

The following code displays the in-degree centrality of all nodes.

```python
iG7 = [G7.in_degree(v) for v in G7.nodes()]   # computing in-degree centrality

for i, d in enumerate(iG7):
    print(i+1, d)
```

    1 2
    2 3
    3 1
    4 3
    5 0
    6 2
    7 0

Consider the international credit network displayed in Fig. 41.4.

The following plot displays the in-degree centrality of each country.

```python
D = qbn_io.build_unweighted_matrix(Z)
indegree = D.sum(axis=0)
```

```python
def centrality_plot_data(countries, centrality_measures):
    df = pd.DataFrame({'code': countries,
                       'centrality':centrality_measures,
                       'color': qbn_io.colorise_weights(centrality_measures).tolist()
                       })
    return df.sort_values('centrality')
```

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

df = centrality_plot_data(countries, indegree)

ax.bar('code', 'centrality', data=df, color=df["color"], alpha=0.6)

patch = mpatches.Patch(color=None, label='in degree', visible=False)
ax.legend(handles=[patch], fontsize=12, loc="upper left", handlelength=0, frameon=False)

ax.set_ylim((0,20))

plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/networks_files/networks_58_0.png)

Unfortunately, while in-degree and out-degree centrality are simple to
calculate, they are not always informative.

In Fig. 41.4, an edge exists between almost every node,
so the in- or out-degree based centrality ranking fails to effectively separate the countries.

This can be seen in the above graph as well.

Another example is the task of a web search engine, which ranks pages
by relevance whenever a user enters a search.

Suppose web page A has twice as many inbound links as page B.

In-degree centrality tells us that page A deserves a higher rank.

But in fact, page A might be less important than page B.

To see why, suppose that the links to A are from pages that receive almost no traffic,
while the links to B are from pages that receive very heavy traffic.

In this case, page B probably receives more visitors, which in turn suggests
that page B contains more valuable (or entertaining) content.

Thinking about this point suggests that importance might be _recursive_.

This means that the importance of a given node depends on the importance of
other nodes that link to it.

As another example, we can imagine a production network where the importance of a
given sector depends on the importance of the sectors that it supplies.

This reverses the order of the previous example: now the importance of a given
node depends on the importance of other nodes that _it links to_.

The next centrality measures will have these recursive features.

### Eigenvector centrality

Suppose we have a weighted directed graph with adjacency matrix $ A $.

For simplicity, we will suppose that the nodes $ V $ of the graph are just the
integers $ 1, \ldots, n $.

Let $ r(A) $ denote the **spectral radius** of $ A $.

The **eigenvector centrality** of the graph is defined as the $ n $-vector $ e $ that solves

$$
\begin{aligned}
e = \frac{1}{r(A)} A e.
\end{aligned} \tag{41.1}
$$

In other words, $ e $ is the dominant eigenvector of $ A $ (the eigenvector of the
largest eigenvalue — see the discussion of
the **Perron-Frobenius theorem** in the eigenvalue lecture.

To better understand [(41.1)](#equation-ev-central), we write out the full expression
for some element $ e_i $

$$
\begin{aligned}
e_i = \frac{1}{r(A)} \sum_{1 \leq j \leq n} a_{ij} e_j
\end{aligned} \tag{41.2}
$$

Note the recursive nature of the definition: the centrality obtained by node
$ i $ is proportional to a sum of the centrality of all nodes, weighted by
the _rates of flow_ from $ i $ into these nodes.

A node $ i $ is highly ranked if

1. there are many edges leaving $ i $,
1. these edges have large weights, and
1. the edges point to other highly ranked nodes.

Later, when we study demand shocks in production networks, there will be a more
concrete interpretation of eigenvector centrality.

We will see that, in production networks, sectors with high eigenvector
centrality are important _suppliers_.

In particular, they are activated by a wide array of demand shocks once orders
flow backwards through the network.

To compute eigenvector centrality we can use the following function.

```python
def eigenvector_centrality(A, k=40, authority=False):
    """
    Computes the dominant eigenvector of A. Assumes A is
    primitive and uses the power method.

    """
    A_temp = A.T if authority else A
    n = len(A_temp)
    r = np.max(np.abs(np.linalg.eigvals(A_temp)))
    e = r**(-k) * (np.linalg.matrix_power(A_temp, k) @ np.ones(n))
    return e / np.sum(e)
```

Let’s compute eigenvector centrality for the graph generated in Fig. 41.6.

```python
A = nx.to_numpy_array(G7)         # compute adjacency matrix of graph
```

```python
e = eigenvector_centrality(A)
n = len(e)

for i in range(n):
    print(i+1,e[i])
```

    1 0.18580570704268035
    2 0.18580570704268035
    3 0.11483424225608216
    4 0.11483424225608216
    5 0.14194292957319637
    6 0.11483424225608216
    7 0.14194292957319637

While nodes $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ had the highest in-degree centrality, we can see that nodes $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ have the
highest eigenvector centrality.

Let’s revisit the international credit network in Fig. 41.4.

```python
eig_central = eigenvector_centrality(Z)
```

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

df = centrality_plot_data(countries, eig_central)

ax.bar('code', 'centrality', data=df, color=df["color"], alpha=0.6)

patch = mpatches.Patch(color=None, visible=False)
ax.legend(handles=[patch], fontsize=12, loc="upper left", handlelength=0, frameon=False)

plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/networks_files/networks_67_0.png)

Countries that are rated highly according to this rank tend to be important
players in terms of supply of credit.

Japan takes the highest rank according to this measure, although
countries with large financial sectors such as Great Britain and France are
not far behind.

The advantage of eigenvector centrality is that it measures a node’s importance while considering the importance of its
neighbours.

A variant of eigenvector centrality is at the core of Google’s PageRank algorithm, which is used to rank web pages.

The main principle is that links from important nodes (as measured by degree centrality) are worth more than links from
unimportant nodes.

### Katz centrality

One problem with eigenvector centrality is that $ r(A) $ might be zero, in which
case $ 1/r(A) $ is not defined.

For this and other reasons, some researchers prefer another measure of
centrality for networks called Katz centrality.

Fixing $ \beta $ in $ (0, 1/r(A)) $, the **Katz centrality** of a weighted
directed graph with adjacency matrix $ A $ is defined as the vector $ \kappa $
that solves

$$
\kappa_i = \beta \sum_{1 \leq j 1} a_{ij} \kappa_j + 1
\qquad \text{for all } i \in \{0, \ldots, n-1\}. \tag{41.3}
$$

Here $ \beta $ is a parameter that we can choose.

In vector form we can write

$$
\kappa = \mathbf 1 + \beta A \kappa \tag{41.4}
$$

where $ \mathbf 1 $ is a column vector of ones.

The intuition behind this centrality measure is similar to that provided for
eigenvector centrality: high centrality is conferred on $ i $ when it is linked
to by nodes that themselves have high centrality.

Provided that $ 0 < \beta < 1/r(A) $, Katz centrality is always finite and well-defined
because then $ r(\beta A) < 1 $.

This means that [(41.4)](#equation-katz-central-vec) has the unique solution

$$
\kappa = (I - \beta A)^{-1} \mathbf{1}
$$

This follows from the **Neumann series theorem**.

The parameter $ \beta $ is used to ensure that $ \kappa $ is finite

When $ r(A)<1 $, we use $ \beta=1 $ as the default for Katz centrality computations.

### Authorities vs hubs

Search engine designers recognize that web pages can be important in two
different ways.

Some pages have high **hub centrality**, meaning that they link to valuable
sources of information (e.g., news aggregation sites).

Other pages have high **authority centrality**, meaning that they contain
valuable information, as indicated by the number and significance of incoming
links (e.g., websites of respected news organizations).

Similar ideas can and have been applied to economic networks (often using
different terminology).

The eigenvector centrality and Katz centrality measures we discussed above
measure hub centrality.

(Nodes have high centrality if they point to other nodes with high centrality.)

If we care more about authority centrality, we can use the same definitions
except that we take the transpose of the adjacency matrix.

This works because taking the transpose reverses the direction of the arrows.

(Now nodes will have high centrality if they receive links from other nodes
with high centrality.)

For example, the **authority-based eigenvector centrality** of a weighted
directed graph with adjacency matrix $ A $ is the vector $ e $ solving

$$
e = \frac{1}{r(A)} A^\top e. \tag{41.5}
$$

The only difference from the original definition is that $ A $ is replaced by
its transpose.

(Transposes do not affect the spectral radius of a matrix so we wrote $ r(A) $ instead of $ r(A^\top) $.)

Element-by-element, this is given by

$$
e_j = \frac{1}{r(A)} \sum_{1 \leq i \leq n} a_{ij} e_i \tag{41.6}
$$

We see $ e_j $ will be high if many nodes with high authority rankings link to $ j $.

The following figurenshows the authority-based eigenvector centrality ranking for the international
credit network shown in Fig. 41.4.

```python
ecentral_authority = eigenvector_centrality(Z, authority=True)
```

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

df = centrality_plot_data(countries, ecentral_authority)

ax.bar('code', 'centrality', data=df, color=df["color"], alpha=0.6)

patch = mpatches.Patch(color=None, visible=False)
ax.legend(handles=[patch], fontsize=12, loc="upper left", handlelength=0, frameon=False)

plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/networks_files/networks_72_0.png)

Highly ranked countries are those that attract large inflows of credit, or
credit inflows from other major players.

In this case the US clearly dominates the rankings as a target of interbank credit.

## Exercises

## Exercise 41.1

Here is a mathematical exercise for those who like proofs.

Let $ (V, E) $ be a directed graph and write $ u \sim v $ if $ u $ and $ v $ communicate.

Show that $ \sim $ is an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation) on $ V $.

## Solution to Exercise 41.1

**Reflexivity:**

Trivially, $ u = v \Rightarrow u \rightarrow v $.

Thus, $ u \sim u $.

**Symmetry:**
Suppose, $ u \sim v $

$ \Rightarrow u \rightarrow v $ and $ v \rightarrow u $.

By definition, this implies $ v \sim u $.

**Transitivity:**

Suppose, $ u \sim v $ and $ v \sim w $

This implies, $ u \rightarrow v $ and $ v \rightarrow u $ and also $ v \rightarrow w $ and $ w \rightarrow v $.

Thus, we can conclude $ u \rightarrow v \rightarrow w $ and $ w \rightarrow v \rightarrow u $.

Which means $ u \sim w $.

## Exercise 41.2

Consider a directed graph $ G $ with the set of nodes

$$
V = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}
$$

and the set of edges

$$

1. Use `Networkx` to draw graph $ G $.
1. Find the associated adjacency matrix $ A $ for $ G $.
1. Use the functions defined above to compute in-degree centrality, out-degree centrality and eigenvector centrality

## Exercise 41.3

Consider a graph $ G $ with $ n $ nodes and $ n \times n $ adjacency matrix $ A $.

Let $ S = \sum\_{k=0}^{n-1} A^k $

We can say for any two nodes $ i $ and $ j $, $ j $ is accessible from $ i $ if and only if
$ S\_{ij} > 0 $.

Devise a function `is_accessible` that checks if any two nodes of a given graph are accessible.

Consider the graph in Exercise 41.2 and use this function to check if

1. $ 1 $ is accessible from $ 2 $
1. $ 6 $ is accessible from $ 3 $
