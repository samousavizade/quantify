# Geometric Series for Elementary Economics

## Overview

This lecture covers key economic concepts that utilize the mathematics of geometric series, including:

- The Keynesian **multiplier**
- The money **multiplier** in fractional reserve banking systems
- Interest rates and the present value of asset payout streams

(As we will explore, the term **multiplier** essentially refers to the **sum of a convergent geometric series**.)

These concepts illustrate the adage:

> “In economics, a little knowledge of geometric series goes a long way.”

We'll begin by using the following imports:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (11, 5)  #set default figure size
import numpy as np
import sympy as sym
from sympy import init_printing
from matplotlib import cm
```

## Key Formulas

Consider a real number $ c $ strictly between $ -1 $ and $ 1 $.

- We denote this as $ c \in (-1,1) $.
- The interval $ (-1,1) $ represents all real numbers greater than $ -1 $ and less than $ 1 $.
- The symbol $ \in $ signifies "belongs to" or "is a member of" the set following it.

We are interested in evaluating two types of geometric series: infinite and finite.

### Infinite Geometric Series

The infinite geometric series of interest is:

$$
1 + c + c^2 + c^3 + \cdots
$$

where $ \cdots $ indicates that the series extends indefinitely.

The key formula for this series is:

$$
1 + c + c^2 + c^3 + \cdots = \frac{1}{1 -c } \tag{10.1}
$$

To verify formula [(10.1)](#equation-infinite), multiply both sides by $ (1-c) $ and confirm that if $ c \in (-1,1) $, the result simplifies to $ 1 = 1 $.

### Finite Geometric Series

The finite geometric series we consider is:

$$
1 + c + c^2 + c^3 + \cdots + c^T
$$

where $ T $ is a positive integer.

The formula for this series is:

$$
1 + c + c^2 + c^3 + \cdots + c^T  = \frac{1 - c^{T+1}}{1-c}
$$

**Remark:** This formula applies to any scalar value of $ c $, not restricted to $ (-1,1) $.

Next, we explore famous economic applications of geometric series.

## Example: The Money Multiplier in Fractional Reserve Banking

In fractional reserve banking, banks keep a fraction $ r \in (0,1) $ of cash for each deposit receipt they issue:

- Historically, cash was either paper money or metallic coins.
- A _deposit_ is an amount in a checking or savings account that can be redeemed on demand.
- The reserve ratio $ r $ is set by the government or chosen by banks for precautionary reasons.

Economists define the **supply of money** as the total of **cash** plus **deposits**.

In a fractional reserve system (where $ 0 < r < 1 $), banks create money by issuing deposits backed by fractional reserves and loans.

The geometric series formula [(10.1)](#equation-infinite) underpins the classic money creation model, leading to the **money multiplier**.

### A Simple Model

Banks are indexed as $ i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots $.

Each bank $ i $’s loans $ L_i $, deposits $ D_i $, and reserves $ R_i $ satisfy:

$$
L_i + R_i = D_i \tag{10.2}
$$

Each bank sets its reserves to meet:

$$
R_i = r D_i \tag{10.3}
$$

where $ r \in (0,1) $ is the **reserve-deposit ratio**.

Bank $ i+1 $’s deposits depend on the loans from bank $ i $:

$$
D_{i+1} = L_i \tag{10.4}
$$

The initial deposit in bank $ 0 $ is given as:

$$
D_0 \ \text{is exogenously given}
$$

Combining equations [(10.2)](#equation-balance) and [(10.3)](#equation-reserves):

$$
L_i = (1-r) D_i \tag{10.5}
$$

From this, we find:

$$
D_{i+1} = (1-r) D_i  \ \text{for } i \geq 0
$$

This leads to:

$$
D_i = (1 - r)^i D_0  \ \text{for } i \geq 0 \tag{10.6}
$$

The total deposits in the banking system are:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^\infty (1-r)^i D_0 =  \frac{D_0}{1 - (1-r)} = \frac{D_0}{r} \tag{10.7}
$$

### Money Multiplier

The **money multiplier** is the factor by which an initial cash deposit into bank $ 0 $ increases total deposits in the banking system.

According to equation [(10.7)](#equation-sumdeposits), the money multiplier is $ \frac{1}{r} $.

- An initial deposit $ D_0 $ in bank $ 0 $ results in total deposits of $ \frac{D_0}{r} $ across the system.

## Example: The Keynesian Multiplier

John Maynard Keynes developed a model to determine national income $ y $ in scenarios where:

- There is excess supply of labor and capital.
- Prices and interest rates do not adjust to balance supply and demand.
- National income is solely determined by aggregate demand.

### Static Version

The Keynesian model consists of:

1. A national income identity: $ c + i = y $, where $ c $ is consumption and $ i $ is investment.
2. A consumption function: $ c = b y $, with $ b \in (0,1) $ as the **marginal propensity to consume**.
3. Investment is constant: $ i $.

Substituting the consumption function into the identity gives:

$$
(1-b) y = i
$$

Solving for $ y $:

$$
y = \frac{1}{1-b} i
$$

The multiplier is:

$$
\frac{1}{1-b} = \sum_{t=0}^\infty b^t
$$

### Dynamic Version

To include a time component, we assume:

- Consumption at time $ t $ depends on income from the previous period.
- Investment $ i_t $ is constant over time.

Thus:

$$
y_t = b y_{t-1} + i = (1+ b + b^2 + \cdots + b^t) i
$$

or:

$$
y_t = \frac{1-b^{t+1}}{1 -b } i
$$

As $ t \rightarrow \infty $:

$$
y_t \rightarrow \frac{1}{1-b} i
$$

**Remark 1:** An increase in investment $ \Delta i $ at time $ 0 $ initiates a process of increasing national income.

**Remark 2:** If $ g_t $ represents government expenditures, the **government expenditures multiplier** is also $ \frac{1}{1-b} $.

## Example: Interest Rates and Present Values

Geometric series help us understand how interest rates impact the value of future dollar payments.

Consider:

- A one-period **net nominal interest rate** $ r \in (0,1) $.
- The **gross nominal interest rate** $ R = 1 + r \in (1,2) $.

**Accumulation**

The geometric sequence $ 1, R, R^2, \cdots $ shows how invested dollars grow over time:

$$
x , xR , x R^2, \cdots
$$

**Discounting**

The sequence $ 1, R^{-1}, R^{-2}, \cdots $ helps discount future dollars to present value:

$$
\text{Value of } x \text{ dollars at time } t = x R^{-j}
$$

### Application to Asset Pricing

For a lease with payments $ x_t = G^t x_0 $, where $ G = (1+g) $ and $ g \in (0,1) $, the present value is:

$$
p_0  = x_0 \frac{1}{1 - G R^{-1}}
$$

Using approximations:

$$
p_0 \approx \frac{x_0}{r - g}
$$

For finite leases, the present value is:

$$
p_0 = \frac{x_0(1-G^{T+1}R^{-(T+1)})}{1-GR^{-1}}
$$

Using Taylor series approximations:

$$
p_0 \approx x_0(T+1) + \frac{x_0rg(T+1)}{r-g}
$$

We will plot the true finite stream present value and its approximations in Python.

```python
# True present value of a finite lease
def finite_lease_pv_true(T, g, r, x_0):
    G = (1 + g)
    R = (1 + r)
    return (x_0 * (1 - G**(T + 1) * R**(-T - 1))) / (1 - G * R**(-1))
# First approximation for our finite lease

def finite_lease_pv_approx_1(T, g, r, x_0):
    p = x_0 * (T + 1) + x_0 * r * g * (T + 1) / (r - g)
    return p

# Second approximation for our finite lease
def finite_lease_pv_approx_2(T, g, r, x_0):
    return (x_0 * (T + 1))

# Infinite lease
def infinite_lease(g, r, x_0):
    G = (1 + g)
    R = (1 + r)
    return x_0 / (1 - G * R**(-1))
```

The comparison between the true present value and the approximations for various lease lengths $ T $:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the true present value and approximation functions
def finite_lease_pv_true(T, g, r, x_0):
    R = 1 + r
    G = 1 + g
    return x_0 * (1 - G**(T+1) * R**(-(T+1))) / (1 - G * R**-1)

def finite_lease_pv_approx_1(T, g, r, x_0):
    R = 1 + r
    G = 1 + g
    return x_0 * (T + 1) + x_0 * r * g * (T + 1) / (r - g)

def finite_lease_pv_approx_2(T, g, r, x_0):
    return x_0 * (T + 1)

# Plotting functions
def plot_function(axes, x_vals, func, args):
    axes.plot(x_vals, func(*args), label=func.__name__)

# Parameters
T_max = 50
T = np.arange(0, T_max + 1)
g = 0.02
r = 0.03
x_0 = 1

# Functions to compare
funcs = [finite_lease_pv_true, finite_lease_pv_approx_1, finite_lease_pv_approx_2]
our_args = (T, g, r, x_0)

# Plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
for f in funcs:
    plot_function(ax, T, f, our_args)
ax.legend()
ax.set_xlabel('$T$ Periods Ahead')
ax.set_ylabel('Present Value, $p_0$')
plt.title('Comparison of Lease Present Value Approximations')
plt.show()
```

### Explanation

1. **Define Functions**: `finite_lease_pv_true` computes the exact present value of the lease, while `finite_lease_pv_approx_1` and `finite_lease_pv_approx_2` provide the approximations.
2. **Plotting Function**: `plot_function` plots each function against the range of $ T $ values.
3. **Parameters**: Set up parameters for $ T $, $ g $, $ r $, and $ x_0 $.
4. **Plot**: Generate the plot comparing the true present value with the approximations for lease lengths $ T $.

```python
# Convergence of infinite and finite
T_max = 1000
T = np.arange(0, T_max+1)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
f_1 = finite_lease_pv_true(T, g, r, x_0)
f_2 = np.full(T_max+1, infinite_lease(g, r, x_0))
ax.plot(T, f_1, label='T-period lease PV')
ax.plot(T, f_2, '--', label='Infinite lease PV')
ax.set_xlabel('$T$ Periods Ahead')
ax.set_ylabel('Present Value, $p_0$')
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

The chart above illustrates that as the lease duration $ T $ tends towards infinity, the value of a lease with duration $ T $ converges to that of a perpetuity.

Next, we'll explore two perspectives on the effects of variations in $ r $ and $ g $.

```python
# First view
# Changing r and g
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_ylabel('Present Value, $p_0$')
ax.set_xlabel('$T$ periods ahead')
T_max = 10
T=np.arange(0, T_max+1)

rs, gs = (0.9, 0.5, 0.4001, 0.4), (0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.5),
comparisons = ('$\gg$', '$>$', r'$\approx$', '$<$')
for r, g, comp in zip(rs, gs, comparisons):
    ax.plot(finite_lease_pv_true(T, g, r, x_0), label=f'r(={r}) {comp} g(={g})')

ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/geom_series_files/geom_series_22_0.png)

This chart strongly suggests why the condition $ r > g $ is crucial for ensuring that a lease of infinite length $ T = +\infty $ has a finite value.

For those who appreciate 3-D graphs, the same insight is presented in the following 3-D visualization.

If 3-D graphs aren't your preference, you can skip the next visualization!

```python
# Second view
fig = plt.figure(figsize = [16, 5])
T = 3
ax = plt.subplot(projection='3d')
r = np.arange(0.01, 0.99, 0.005)
g = np.arange(0.011, 0.991, 0.005)

rr, gg = np.meshgrid(r, g)
z = finite_lease_pv_true(T, gg, rr, x_0)

# Removes points where undefined
same = (rr == gg)
z[same] = np.nan
surf = ax.plot_surface(rr, gg, z, cmap=cm.coolwarm,
    antialiased=True, clim=(0, 15))
fig.colorbar(surf, shrink=0.5, aspect=5)
ax.set_xlabel('$r$')
ax.set_ylabel('$g$')
ax.set_zlabel('Present Value, $p_0$')
ax.view_init(20, 8)
plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/geom_series_files/geom_series_24_0.png)

To explore how the present value $ p_0 $ of a lease changes with respect to $ r $ and $ g $, we can apply some calculus.

We will use a library called [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/), which allows for symbolic mathematics and includes tools for computing derivatives of algebraic expressions.

We'll start by creating a symbolic expression for the present value formula of an infinite lease and then use SymPy to calculate its derivatives.

```python
# Creates algebraic symbols that can be used in an algebraic expression
g, r, x0 = sym.symbols('g, r, x0')
G = (1 + g)
R = (1 + r)
p0 = x0 / (1 - G * R**(-1))
init_printing(use_latex='mathjax')
print('Our formula is:')
p0
```

    Our formula is:

$\displaystyle \frac{x_{0}}{- \frac{g + 1}{r + 1} + 1}$

```python
print('dp0 / dg is:')
dp_dg = sym.diff(p0, g)
dp_dg
```

    dp0 / dg is:

$\displaystyle \frac{x_{0}}{\left(r + 1\right) \left(- \frac{g + 1}{r + 1} + 1\right)^{2}}$

```python
print('dp0 / dr is:')
dp_dr = sym.diff(p0, r)
dp_dr
```

    dp0 / dr is:

$\displaystyle - \frac{x_{0} \left(g + 1\right)}{\left(r + 1\right)^{2} \left(- \frac{g + 1}{r + 1} + 1\right)^{2}}$

We observe that $ \frac{\partial p_0 }{\partial r} < 0 $ as long as $ r > g $, $ r > 0 $, $ g > 0 $, and $ x_0 $ is positive. Thus, $ \frac{\partial p_0}{\partial r} $ will always be negative.

In contrast, $ \frac{ \partial p_0 }{\partial g} > 0 $ under the same conditions, meaning $ \frac{ \partial p_0 }{\partial g} $ will always be positive.

## Revisiting the Keynesian Multiplier

Next, we'll return to the Keynesian multiplier case and plot the time path of $ y_t $, considering that consumption is a constant fraction of national income and investment remains fixed.

```python
# Function that calculates a path of y
def calculate_y(i, b, g, T, y_init):
    y = np.zeros(T+1)
    y[0] = i + b * y_init + g
    for t in range(1, T+1):
        y[t] = b * y[t-1] + i + g
    return y

# Initial values
i_0 = 0.3
g_0 = 0.3
# 2/3 of income goes towards consumption
b = 2/3
y_init = 0
T = 100

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_xlabel('$t$')
ax.set_ylabel('$y_t$')
ax.plot(np.arange(0, T+1), calculate_y(i_0, b, g_0, T, y_init))
# Output predicted by geometric series
ax.hlines(i_0 / (1 - b) + g_0 / (1 - b), xmin=-1, xmax=101, linestyles='--')
plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/geom_series_files/geom_series_31_0.png)

In this model, income increases over time and eventually approaches the sum of the infinite geometric series of income.

Next, we will explore the effects of varying the **marginal propensity to consume**, which is the fraction of income that is consumed.

```python
bs = (1/3, 2/3, 5/6, 0.9)

fig,ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_ylabel('$y_t$')
ax.set_xlabel('$t$')
x = np.arange(0, T+1)
for b in bs:
    y = calculate_y(i_0, b, g_0, T, y_init)
    ax.plot(x, y, label=r'$b=$'+f"{b:.2f}")
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/geom_series_files/geom_series_33_0.png)

Raising the marginal propensity to consume, $ b $, leads to an increase in the output trajectory over time.

Next, we will compare how increases in investment and government spending affect output.

```python
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(6, 10))
fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.3)

x = np.arange(0, T+1)
values = [0.3, 0.4]

for i in values:
    y = calculate_y(i, b, g_0, T, y_init)
    ax1.plot(x, y, label=f"i={i}")
for g in values:
    y = calculate_y(i_0, b, g, T, y_init)
    ax2.plot(x, y, label=f"g={g}")

axes = ax1, ax2
param_labels = "Investment", "Government Spending"
for ax, param in zip(axes, param_labels):
    ax.set_title(f'An Increase in {param} on Output')
    ax.legend(loc ="lower right")
    ax.set_ylabel('$y_t$')
    ax.set_xlabel('$t$')
plt.show()
```

![png](/static/courses/Introduction-to-Quantitative-Economics/geom_series_files/geom_series_35_0.png)

Observe that whether government spending rises from 0.3 to 0.4 or investment increases from 0.3 to 0.4, the changes in the graphs are identical.
