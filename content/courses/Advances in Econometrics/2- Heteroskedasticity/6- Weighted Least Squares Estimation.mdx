## Weighted Least Squares Estimation

### The Heteroskedasticity Is Known up to a Multiplicative Constant

Weighted Least Squares (WLS) is an estimation technique used in econometrics to handle heteroskedasticity, which occurs when the variance of the error terms in a regression model is not constant across observations. When heteroskedasticity is known up to a multiplicative constant, WLS can be applied to obtain efficient and unbiased estimates.

#### **Understanding the Known Heteroskedasticity**

When heteroskedasticity is known up to a multiplicative constant, it means that the variance of the error term for each observation is proportional to a known function of the independent variable(s). Mathematically, if the variance of the error term $$ u_i $$ is $$ \sigma_i^2 = \sigma^2 h(x_i) $$, where $$ h(x_i) $$ is a known function, then the errors are heteroskedastic.

#### **Weighted Least Squares Estimation**

To perform WLS, each observation in the regression model is weighted by the inverse of its variance. This process transforms the model into one with homoskedastic errors, allowing for efficient estimation.

1. **Model Transformation**:

- Start with the original model:
  $$
  y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i
  $$
- Given that $$ \text{Var}(u_i) = \sigma^2 h(x_i) $$, transform the model by dividing each term by $$ \sqrt{h(x_i)} $$:
  $$
  \frac{y_i}{\sqrt{h(x_i)}} = \beta_0 \frac{1}{\sqrt{h(x_i)}} + \beta_1 \frac{x_i}{\sqrt{h(x_i)}} + \frac{u_i}{\sqrt{h(x_i)}}
  $$
- This transformation ensures that the transformed error term has constant variance.

2. **Weighted Regression**:

- Perform OLS on the transformed model. The weights used in WLS are typically $$ w_i = 1/h(x_i) $$.
- The WLS estimator minimizes the weighted sum of squared residuals:
  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2
  $$

3. **Efficiency and Consistency**:

- WLS provides efficient and consistent estimates of the regression coefficients under heteroskedasticity when the form of heteroskedasticity is correctly specified.

### **Example Application**

Suppose you are analyzing household expenditure data where expenditure variability increases with income. If it is known that $$ \text{Var}(u_i) = \sigma^2 x_i^2 $$, where $$ x_i $$ represents income, then WLS can be applied with weights $$ w_i = 1/x_i^2 $$. This transformation will stabilize the variance across observations, allowing for more reliable inference from the regression model.

By using WLS when heteroskedasticity is known up to a multiplicative constant, econometricians can obtain more reliable estimates and make valid inferences about economic relationships.
