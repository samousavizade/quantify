### Correcting for Higher-Order Serial Correlation

#### Introduction

In time series econometrics, serial correlation in the error terms can pose significant challenges to the validity of regression results. While first-order serial correlation (AR(1)) is commonly addressed, higher-order serial correlations, where errors are correlated over multiple lags, require more sophisticated approaches for correction. This section focuses on methods for correcting higher-order serial correlation in regression models with strictly exogenous regressors.

#### Higher-Order Autoregressive Processes

An autoregressive process of order $$ p $$, denoted as AR(p), assumes that the current value of a series depends linearly on its previous $$ p $$ values. The model can be represented as:

$$
u_t = \rho_1 u_{t-1} + \rho_2 u_{t-2} + \cdots + \rho_p u_{t-p} + \epsilon_t
$$

where $$ \epsilon_t $$ is a white noise error term with mean zero and constant variance.

#### Challenges of Higher-Order Serial Correlation

1. **Bias in OLS Estimators**: Higher-order serial correlations can lead to biased OLS standard errors, affecting hypothesis testing.
2. **Complexity**: The presence of multiple lags complicates the model structure and requires more sophisticated testing and correction methods.

#### Methods for Correcting Higher-Order Serial Correlation

To address higher-order serial correlation, several methods can be employed:

###### 1. **Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS)**

FGLS is an extension of GLS that can be used to correct for higher-order serial correlation by transforming the model based on an estimated error structure.

####### Steps for FGLS with AR(p) Errors

1. **Estimate Initial Model**: Begin by estimating the regression model using OLS to obtain residuals $$ \hat{u}\_t $$.

2. **Estimate AR(p) Parameters**: Use these residuals to estimate the parameters $$ \rho_1, \rho_2, \ldots, \rho_p $$ of the AR(p) process by regressing $$ \hat{u}\_t $$ on its lagged values up to order $$ p $$.

3. **Transform the Model**: Use the estimated parameters to transform the original regression model:

For example, if $$ p = 2 $$:

$$
y_t - \hat{\rho}_1 y_{t-1} - \hat{\rho}_2 y_{t-2} = (\beta_0 (1 - \hat{\rho}_1 - \hat{\rho}_2)) + \beta_1 (x_t - \hat{\rho}_1 x_{t-1} - \hat{\rho}_2 x_{t-2}) + v_t
$$

where $$ v*t = \epsilon_t - \hat{\rho}\_1 \epsilon*{t-1} - \hat{\rho}_2 \epsilon_{t-2} $$ is a transformed error term that is not serially correlated.

4. **Estimate Transformed Model**: Apply OLS to the transformed model to obtain efficient estimates of the parameters.

###### 2. **Newey-West Standard Errors**

Newey-West standard errors provide a robust method for adjusting standard errors to account for higher-order autocorrelation without transforming the model.

- **Procedure**:

1. Estimate the OLS model as usual.
2. Calculate Newey-West standard errors using a specified lag length that accounts for potential higher-order autocorrelation.

- **Advantages**:
- Simple to implement.
- Does not require specifying or estimating a full autoregressive error structure.

###### 3. **Autoregressive Distributed Lag Models (ARDL)**

Including lagged values of both dependent and independent variables can capture dynamic relationships and mitigate serial correlation.

- **Model Specification**:

An ARDL(p, q) model includes lagged values of both dependent and independent variables:

$$
y_t = c + \sum_{i=0}^{p} \alpha_i y_{t-i} + \sum_{j=0}^{q} \beta_j x_{t-j} + u_t
$$

#### Conclusion

Correcting for higher-order serial correlation involves using methods like FGLS, Newey-West standard errors, or ARDL models that accommodate complex autoregressive structures. These methods ensure efficient estimation and reliable inference in time series regression models with strictly exogenous regressors. By addressing higher-order serial correlation, researchers can improve the precision and validity of their econometric analysis.
