I am currently a Software Developer at [Aphex](https://aphex.co/).
I was previously a Jr. Backend Developer at Code and Theory Manila
where I mostly used PHP to create back-end APIs for the front-ends to consume.
Now I am more focused on JavaScript and the front-end side of things
where I am using ReactJS to create beautiful and reusable user interfaces.
